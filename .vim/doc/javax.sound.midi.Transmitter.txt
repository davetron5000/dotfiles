*javax.sound.midi.Transmitter_Description*

A Transmitter sends (|javax.sound.midi.MidiEvent|) objects to one or more 
Receivers(|javax.sound.midi.Receiver|) . Common MIDI transmitters include 
sequencers and MIDI input ports. 


*javax.sound.midi.Transmitter.close()*

public void close()

Indicates that the application has finished using the transmitter, and that 
limited resources it requires may be released or made available. 

If the creation of this Transmitter resulted in implicitly opening the 
underlying device, the device is implicitly closed by this method. This is true 
unless the device is kept open by other Receiver or Transmitter instances that 
opened the device implicitly, and unless the device has been opened explicitly. 
If the device this Transmitter is retrieved from is closed explicitly by 
calling MidiDevice.close(|javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice|) , the Transmitter is 
closed, too. For a detailed description of open/close behaviour see the class 
description of MidiDevice(|javax.sound.midi.MidiDevice|) . 


*javax.sound.midi.Transmitter.getReceiver()*

public |javax.sound.midi.Receiver| getReceiver()

Obtains the current receiver to which this transmitter will deliver MIDI 
messages. 


    Returns: the current receiver. If no receiver is currently set, returns null 
*javax.sound.midi.Transmitter.setReceiver(Receiver)*

public void setReceiver(javax.sound.midi.Receiver receiver)

Sets the receiver to which this transmitter will deliver MIDI messages. If a 
receiver is currently set, it is replaced with this one. 

    receiver - the desired receiver.
