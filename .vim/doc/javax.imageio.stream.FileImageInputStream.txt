*javax.imageio.stream.FileImageInputStream_Description*

An implementation of ImageInputStream that gets its input from a File or 
RandomAccessFile. The file contents are assumed to be stable during the 
lifetime of the object. 


*javax.imageio.stream.FileImageInputStream(File)*

public FileImageInputStream(java.io.File f)
  throws |java.io.FileNotFoundException|
         |java.io.IOException|
         
Constructs a FileImageInputStream that will read from a given File. 

The file contents must not change between the time this object is constructed 
and the time of the last call to a read method. 

    f - a File to read from. 

*javax.imageio.stream.FileImageInputStream(RandomAccessFile)*

public FileImageInputStream(java.io.RandomAccessFile raf)

Constructs a FileImageInputStream that will read from a given RandomAccessFile. 

The file contents must not change between the time this object is constructed 
and the time of the last call to a read method. 

    raf - a RandomAccessFile to read from. 

*javax.imageio.stream.FileImageInputStream.close()*

public void close()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         



*javax.imageio.stream.FileImageInputStream.length()*

public long length()

Returns the length of the underlying file, or -1 if it is unknown. 


    Returns: the file length as a long, or -1. 
*javax.imageio.stream.FileImageInputStream.read()*

public int read()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         



*javax.imageio.stream.FileImageInputStream.read(byte[],int,int)*

public int read(
  byte[] b,
  int off,
  int len)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         



*javax.imageio.stream.FileImageInputStream.seek(long)*

public void seek(long pos)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
