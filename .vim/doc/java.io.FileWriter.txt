*java.io.FileWriter_Description*

Convenience class for writing character files. The constructors of this class 
assume that the default character encoding and the default byte-buffer size are 
acceptable. To specify these values yourself, construct an OutputStreamWriter 
on a FileOutputStream. 

Whether or not a file is available or may be created depends upon the 
underlying platform. Some platforms, in particular, allow a file to be opened 
for writing by only one FileWriter (or other file-writing object) at a time. In 
such situations the constructors in this class will fail if the file involved 
is already open. 

FileWriter is meant for writing streams of characters. For writing streams of 
raw bytes, consider using a FileOutputStream. 


*java.io.FileWriter(File)*

public FileWriter(java.io.File file)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Constructs a FileWriter object given a File object. 

    file - a File object to write to. 

*java.io.FileWriter(File,boolean)*

public FileWriter(
  java.io.File file,
  boolean append)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Constructs a FileWriter object given a File object. If the second argument is 
true, then bytes will be written to the end of the file rather than the 
beginning. 

    file - a File object to write to 
    append - if true, then bytes will be written to the end of the file rather than the 
       beginning 

*java.io.FileWriter(FileDescriptor)*

public FileWriter(java.io.FileDescriptor fd)

Constructs a FileWriter object associated with a file descriptor. 

    fd - FileDescriptor object to write to. 

*java.io.FileWriter(String)*

public FileWriter(java.lang.String fileName)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Constructs a FileWriter object given a file name. 

    fileName - String The system-dependent filename. 

*java.io.FileWriter(String,boolean)*

public FileWriter(
  java.lang.String fileName,
  boolean append)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Constructs a FileWriter object given a file name with a boolean indicating 
whether or not to append the data written. 

    fileName - String The system-dependent filename. 
    append - boolean if true, then data will be written to the end of the file rather than 
       the beginning.
