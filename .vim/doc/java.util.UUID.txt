*java.util.UUID_Description*

A class that represents an immutable universally unique identifier (UUID). A 
UUID represents a 128-bit value. 

There exist different variants of these global identifiers. The methods of this 
class are for manipulating the Leach-Salz variant, although the constructors 
allow the creation of any variant of UUID (described below). 

The layout of a variant 2 (Leach-Salz) UUID is as follows: 

The most significant long consists of the following unsigned fields: 

0xFFFFFFFF00000000 time_low 0x00000000FFFF0000 time_mid 0x000000000000F000 
version 0x0000000000000FFF time_hi 

The least significant long consists of the following unsigned fields: 

0xC000000000000000 variant 0x3FFF000000000000 clock_seq 0x0000FFFFFFFFFFFF node 

The variant field contains a value which identifies the layout of the UUID. The 
bit layout described above is valid only for a UUID with a variant value of 2, 
which indicates the Leach-Salz variant. 

The version field holds a value that describes the type of this UUID. There are 
four different basic types of UUIDs: time-based, DCE security, name-based, and 
randomly generated UUIDs. These types have a version value of 1, 2, 3 and 4, 
respectively. 

For more information including algorithms used to create UUIDs, see the 
Internet-Draft UUIDs and GUIDs or the standards body definition at ISO/IEC 
11578:1996. 


*java.util.UUID(long,long)*

public UUID(
  long mostSigBits,
  long leastSigBits)

Constructs a new UUID using the specified data. mostSigBits is used for the 
most significant 64 bits of the UUID and leastSigBits becomes the least 
significant 64 bits of the UUID. 

    mostSigBits - 
    leastSigBits - 

*java.util.UUID.clockSequence()*

public int clockSequence()

The clock sequence value associated with this UUID. 

The 14 bit clock sequence value is constructed from the clock sequence field of 
this UUID. The clock sequence field is used to guarantee temporal uniqueness in 
a time-based UUID. 

The clockSequence value is only meaningful in a time-based UUID, which has 
version type 1. If this UUID is not a time-based UUID then this method throws 
UnsupportedOperationException. 


    Returns: the clock sequence of this UUID. 
*java.util.UUID.compareTo(UUID)*

public int compareTo(java.util.UUID val)

Compares this UUID with the specified UUID. 

The first of two UUIDs follows the second if the most significant field in 
which the UUIDs differ is greater for the first UUID. 

    val - UUID to which this UUID is to be compared. 

    Returns: -1, 0 or 1 as this UUID is less than, equal to, or greater than val. 
*java.util.UUID.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Compares this object to the specified object. The result is true if and only if 
the argument is not null, is a UUID object, has the same variant, and contains 
the same value, bit for bit, as this UUID. 

    obj - the object to compare with. 

    Returns: true if the objects are the same; false otherwise. 
*java.util.UUID.fromString(String)*

public static |java.util.UUID| fromString(java.lang.String name)

Creates a UUID from the string standard representation as described in the 
(|java.util.UUID|) method. 

    name - a string that specifies a UUID. 

    Returns: a UUID with the specified value. 
*java.util.UUID.getLeastSignificantBits()*

public long getLeastSignificantBits()

Returns the least significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value. 


    Returns: the least significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value. 
*java.util.UUID.getMostSignificantBits()*

public long getMostSignificantBits()

Returns the most significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value. 


    Returns: the most significant 64 bits of this UUID's 128 bit value. 
*java.util.UUID.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns a hash code for this UUID. 


    Returns: a hash code value for this UUID. 
*java.util.UUID.nameUUIDFromBytes(byte[])*

public static |java.util.UUID| nameUUIDFromBytes(byte[] name)

Static factory to retrieve a type 3 (name based) UUID based on the specified 
byte array. 

    name - a byte array to be used to construct a UUID. 

    Returns: a UUID generated from the specified array. 
*java.util.UUID.node()*

public long node()

The node value associated with this UUID. 

The 48 bit node value is constructed from the node field of this UUID. This 
field is intended to hold the IEEE 802 address of the machine that generated 
this UUID to guarantee spatial uniqueness. 

The node value is only meaningful in a time-based UUID, which has version type 
1. If this UUID is not a time-based UUID then this method throws 
UnsupportedOperationException. 


    Returns: the node value of this UUID. 
*java.util.UUID.randomUUID()*

public static |java.util.UUID| randomUUID()

Static factory to retrieve a type 4 (pseudo randomly generated) UUID. 

The UUID is generated using a cryptographically strong pseudo random number 
generator. 


    Returns: a randomly generated UUID. 
*java.util.UUID.timestamp()*

public long timestamp()

The timestamp value associated with this UUID. 

The 60 bit timestamp value is constructed from the time_low, time_mid, and 
time_hi fields of this UUID. The resulting timestamp is measured in 
100-nanosecond units since midnight, October 15, 1582 UTC. 

The timestamp value is only meaningful in a time-based UUID, which has version 
type 1. If this UUID is not a time-based UUID then this method throws 
UnsupportedOperationException. 


*java.util.UUID.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Returns a String object representing this UUID. 

The UUID string representation is as described by this BNF : 

UUID = "-" "-" "-" "-" 

time_low = 4* time_mid = 2* time_high_and_version = 2* variant_and_sequence = 
2* node = 6* hexOctet = hexDigit = "0" | "1" | "2" | "3" | "4" | "5" | "6" | 
"7" | "8" | "9" | "a" | "b" | "c" | "d" | "e" | "f" | "A" | "B" | "C" | "D" | 
"E" | "F" 


    Returns: a string representation of this UUID. 
*java.util.UUID.variant()*

public int variant()

The variant number associated with this UUID. The variant number describes the 
layout of the UUID. 

The variant number has the following meaning: 

0 Reserved for NCS backward compatibility 2 The Leach-Salz variant (used by 
this class) 6 Reserved, Microsoft Corporation backward compatibility 7 Reserved 
for future definition 


    Returns: the variant number of this UUID. 
*java.util.UUID.version()*

public int version()

The version number associated with this UUID. The version number describes how 
this UUID was generated. 

The version number has the following meaning: 

1 Time-based UUID 2 DCE security UUID 3 Name-based UUID 4 Randomly generated 
UUID 


    Returns: the version number of this UUID.
