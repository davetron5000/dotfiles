*java.awt.event.MouseAdapter_Description*

An abstract adapter class for receiving mouse events. The methods in this class 
are empty. This class exists as convenience for creating listener objects. 

Mouse events let you track when a mouse is pressed, released, clicked, when it 
enters a component, and when it exits. (To track mouse moves and mouse drags, 
use the MouseMotionAdapter.) 

Extend this class to create a MouseEvent listener and override the methods for 
the events of interest. (If you implement the MouseListener interface, you have 
to define all of the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods 
for them all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care 
about.) 

Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with a 
component using the component's addMouseListener method. When a mouse button is 
pressed, released, or clicked (pressed and released), or when the mouse cursor 
enters or exits the component, the relevant method in the listener object is 
invoked and the MouseEvent is passed to it.
