Events of this type are either sent to an object that implements 
(|javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionBindingListener|) when it is bound or unbound 
from a session, or to a (|javax.servlet.http.HttpSessionAttributeListener|) 
that has been configured in the deployment descriptor when any attribute is 
bound, unbound or replaced in a session. 

The session binds the object by a call to HttpSession.setAttribute and unbinds 
the object by a call to HttpSession.removeAttribute.
