*javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory_Description*

The EntityManagerFactory interface is used by the application to obtain an 
application-managed entity manager. When the application has finished using the 
entity manager factory, and/or at application shutdown, the application should 
close the entity manager factory. Once an EntityManagerFactory has been closed, 
all its entity managers are considered to be in the closed state. 



*javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory.close()*

public void close()

Close the factory, releasing any resources that it holds. After a factory 
instance is closed, all methods invoked on it will throw an 
IllegalStateException, except for isOpen, which will return false. Once an 
EntityManagerFactory has been closed, all its entity managers are considered to 
be in the closed state. 



*javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager()*

public |javax.persistence.EntityManager| createEntityManager()

Create a new EntityManager. This method returns a new EntityManager instance 
each time it is invoked. The isOpen method will return true on the returned 
instance. 



*javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory.createEntityManager(Map)*

public |javax.persistence.EntityManager| createEntityManager(java.util.Map map)

Create a new EntityManager with the specified Map of properties. This method 
returns a new EntityManager instance each time it is invoked. The isOpen method 
will return true on the returned instance. 



*javax.persistence.EntityManagerFactory.isOpen()*

public boolean isOpen()

Indicates whether or not this factory is open. Returns true until a call to 
close has been made.
