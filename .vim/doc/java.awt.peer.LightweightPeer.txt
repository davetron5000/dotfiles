*java.awt.peer.LightweightPeer_Description*

The LightweightPeer interface marks a component as depending upon a native 
container so window related events can be routed to the component. Since this 
only applies to components and their extensions, this interface extends 
ComponentPeer. 

The peer interfaces are intended only for use in porting the AWT. They are not 
intended for use by application developers, and developers should not implement 
peers nor invoke any of the peer methods directly on the peer instances.
