*java.awt.event.AWTEventListener_Description*

The listener interface for receiving notification of events dispatched to 
objects that are instances of Component or MenuComponent or their subclasses. 
Unlike the other EventListeners in this package, AWTEventListeners passively 
observe events being dispatched in the AWT, system-wide. Most applications 
should never use this class; applications which might use AWTEventListeners 
include event recorders for automated testing, and facilities such as the Java 
Accessibility package. 

The class that is interested in monitoring AWT events implements this 
interface, and the object created with that class is registered with the 
Toolkit, using the Toolkit's addAWTEventListener method. When an event is 
dispatched anywhere in the AWT, that object's eventDispatched method is 
invoked. 


*java.awt.event.AWTEventListener.eventDispatched(AWTEvent)*

public void eventDispatched(java.awt.AWTEvent event)

Invoked when an event is dispatched in the AWT.
