*java.awt.GridBagConstraints()*

public GridBagConstraints()

Creates a GridBagConstraint object with all of its fields set to their default 
value. 


*java.awt.GridBagConstraints(int,int,int,int,double,double,int,int,Insets,int,int)*

public GridBagConstraints(
  int gridx,
  int gridy,
  int gridwidth,
  int gridheight,
  double weightx,
  double weighty,
  int anchor,
  int fill,
  java.awt.Insets insets,
  int ipadx,
  int ipady)

Creates a GridBagConstraints object with all of its fields set to the passed-in 
arguments. 

Note: Because the use of this constructor hinders readability of source code, 
this constructor should only be used by automatic source code generation tools. 

    gridx - The initial gridx value. 
    gridy - The initial gridy value. 
    gridwidth - The initial gridwidth value. 
    gridheight - The initial gridheight value. 
    weightx - The initial weightx value. 
    weighty - The initial weighty value. 
    anchor - The initial anchor value. 
    fill - The initial fill value. 
    insets - The initial insets value. 
    ipadx - The initial ipadx value. 
    ipady - The initial ipady value. 

*java.awt.GridBagConstraints.clone()*

public |java.lang.Object| clone()

Creates a copy of this grid bag constraint. 


    Returns: a copy of this grid bag constraint
