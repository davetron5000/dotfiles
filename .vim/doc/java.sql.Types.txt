*java.sql.Types_Description*

The class that defines the constants that are used to identify generic SQL types, called JDBC types. The actual type constant values are equivalent to those in XOPEN. 

This class is never instantiated. 



*int_java.sql.Types.ARRAY*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type ARRAY. 


*int_java.sql.Types.BIGINT*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type BIGINT. 


*int_java.sql.Types.BINARY*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type BINARY. 


*int_java.sql.Types.BIT*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type BIT. 


*int_java.sql.Types.BLOB*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type BLOB. 


*int_java.sql.Types.BOOLEAN*

The constant in the Java programming language, somtimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type BOOLEAN. 


*int_java.sql.Types.CHAR*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type CHAR. 


*int_java.sql.Types.CLOB*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type CLOB. 


*int_java.sql.Types.DATALINK*

The constant in the Java programming language, somtimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type DATALINK. 


*int_java.sql.Types.DATE*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type DATE. 


*int_java.sql.Types.DECIMAL*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type DECIMAL. 


*int_java.sql.Types.DISTINCT*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type DISTINCT. 


*int_java.sql.Types.DOUBLE*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type DOUBLE. 


*int_java.sql.Types.FLOAT*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type FLOAT. 


*int_java.sql.Types.INTEGER*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type INTEGER. 


*int_java.sql.Types.JAVA_OBJECT*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type JAVA_OBJECT. 


*int_java.sql.Types.LONGVARBINARY*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type LONGVARBINARY. 


*int_java.sql.Types.LONGVARCHAR*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type LONGVARCHAR. 


*int_java.sql.Types.NULL*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type NULL. 


*int_java.sql.Types.NUMERIC*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type NUMERIC. 


*int_java.sql.Types.OTHER*

The constant in the Java programming language that indicates that the SQL type is database-specific and gets mapped to a Java object that can be accessed via the methods getObject 
and setObject. 


*int_java.sql.Types.REAL*

The constant in the Java programming language, sometimes referred to as a type code, that identifies the generic SQL type REAL. 


*int_java.sql.Types.REF*
