*java.security.Timestamp_Description*

This class encapsulates information about a signed timestamp. It is immutable. 
It includes the timestamp's date and time as well as information about the 
Timestamping Authority (TSA) which generated and signed the timestamp. 


*java.security.Timestamp(Date,CertPath)*

public Timestamp(
  java.util.Date timestamp,
  java.security.cert.CertPath signerCertPath)

Constructs a Timestamp. 

    timestamp - is the timestamp's date and time. It must not be null. 
    signerCertPath - is the TSA's certificate path. It must not be null. 

*java.security.Timestamp.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Tests for equality between the specified object and this timestamp. Two 
timestamps are considered equal if the date and time of their timestamp's and 
their signer's certificate paths are equal. 

    obj - the object to test for equality with this timestamp. 

    Returns: true if the timestamp are considered equal, false otherwise. 
*java.security.Timestamp.getSignerCertPath()*

public |java.security.cert.CertPath| getSignerCertPath()

Returns the certificate path for the Timestamping Authority. 


    Returns: The TSA's certificate path. 
*java.security.Timestamp.getTimestamp()*

public |java.util.Date| getTimestamp()

Returns the date and time when the timestamp was generated. 


    Returns: The timestamp's date and time. 
*java.security.Timestamp.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this timestamp. The hash code is generated 
using the date and time of the timestamp and the TSA's certificate path. 


    Returns: a hash code value for this timestamp. 
*java.security.Timestamp.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Returns a string describing this timestamp. 


    Returns: A string comprising the date and time of the timestamp and its signer's 
             certificate.
