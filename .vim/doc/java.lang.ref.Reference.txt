*java.lang.ref.Reference_Description*

Abstract base class for reference objects. This class defines the operations 
common to all reference objects.	Because reference objects are implemented in 
close cooperation with the garbage collector, this class may not be subclassed 
directly. 


*java.lang.ref.Reference.clear()*

public void clear()

Clears this reference object. Invoking this method will not cause this object 
to be enqueued. 


*java.lang.ref.Reference.enqueue()*

public boolean enqueue()

Adds this reference object to the queue with which it is registered, if any. 


    Returns: true if this reference object was successfully enqueued; false if it was 
             already enqueued or if it was not registered with a queue when it 
             was created 
*java.lang.ref.Reference.get()*

public |java.lang.Object| get()

Returns this reference object's referent. If this reference object has been 
cleared, either by the program or by the garbage collector, then this method 
returns null. 


    Returns: The object to which this reference refers, or null if this reference object has 
             been cleared 
*java.lang.ref.Reference.isEnqueued()*

public boolean isEnqueued()

Tells whether or not this reference object has been enqueued, either by the 
program or by the garbage collector. If this reference object was not 
registered with a queue when it was created, then this method will always 
return false. 


    Returns: true if and only if this reference object has been enqueued
