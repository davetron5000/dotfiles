*javax.sql.rowset.spi.TransactionalWriter_Description*

A specialized interface that facilitates an extension of the standard 
SyncProvider abstract class so that it has finer grained transaction control. 

If one or more disconnected RowSet objects are particating in a global 
transaction, they may wish to coordinate their synchronization commits to 
preserve data integrity and reduce the number of sychronization exceptions. If 
this is the case, an application should set the CachedRowSet constant 
COMMIT_ON_ACCEPT_CHANGES to false and use the commit and rollback methods 
defined in this interface to manage transaction boundaries. 


*javax.sql.rowset.spi.TransactionalWriter.commit()*

public void commit()
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Makes permanent all changes that have been performed by the acceptChanges 
method since the last call to either the commit or rollback methods. This 
method should be used only when auto-commit mode has been disabled. 


*javax.sql.rowset.spi.TransactionalWriter.rollback()*

public void rollback()
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Undoes all changes made in the current transaction. This method should be used 
only when auto-commit mode has been disabled. 


*javax.sql.rowset.spi.TransactionalWriter.rollback(Savepoint)*

public void rollback(java.sql.Savepoint s)
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Undoes all changes made in the current transaction made prior to the given 
Savepoint object. This method should be used only when auto-commit mode has 
been disabled. 

    s - a Savepoint object marking a savepoint in the current transaction. All changes 
       made before s was set will be undone. All changes made after s was set 
       will be made permanent.
