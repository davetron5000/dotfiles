*java.awt.event.MouseListener_Description*

The listener interface for receiving "interesting" mouse events (press, 
release, click, enter, and exit) on a component. (To track mouse moves and 
mouse drags, use the MouseMotionListener.) 

The class that is interested in processing a mouse event either implements this 
interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract 
MouseAdapter class (overriding only the methods of interest). 

The listener object created from that class is then registered with a component 
using the component's addMouseListener method. A mouse event is generated when 
the mouse is pressed, released clicked (pressed and released). A mouse event is 
also generated when the mouse cursor enters or leaves a component. When a mouse 
event occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the 
MouseEvent is passed to it. 


*java.awt.event.MouseListener.mouseClicked(MouseEvent)*

public void mouseClicked(java.awt.event.MouseEvent e)

Invoked when the mouse button has been clicked (pressed and released) on a 
component. 


*java.awt.event.MouseListener.mouseEntered(MouseEvent)*

public void mouseEntered(java.awt.event.MouseEvent e)

Invoked when the mouse enters a component. 


*java.awt.event.MouseListener.mouseExited(MouseEvent)*

public void mouseExited(java.awt.event.MouseEvent e)

Invoked when the mouse exits a component. 


*java.awt.event.MouseListener.mousePressed(MouseEvent)*

public void mousePressed(java.awt.event.MouseEvent e)

Invoked when a mouse button has been pressed on a component. 


*java.awt.event.MouseListener.mouseReleased(MouseEvent)*

public void mouseReleased(java.awt.event.MouseEvent e)

Invoked when a mouse button has been released on a component.
