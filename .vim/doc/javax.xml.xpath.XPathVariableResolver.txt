*javax.xml.xpath.XPathVariableResolver_Description*

XPathVariableResolver provides access to the set of user defined XPath 
variables. 

The XPathVariableResolver and the XPath evaluator must adhere to a contract 
that cannot be directly enforced by the API. Although variables may be mutable, 
that is, an application may wish to evaluate the same XPath expression more 
than once with different variable values, in the course of evaluating any 
single XPath expression, a variable's value must be immutable. 


*javax.xml.xpath.XPathVariableResolver.resolveVariable(QName)*

public |java.lang.Object| resolveVariable(javax.xml.namespace.QName variableName)

Find a variable in the set of available variables. 

If variableName is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown. 

    variableName - The QName of the variable name. 

    Returns: The variables value, or null if no variable named variableName exists. The 
             value returned must be of a type appropriate for the underlying 
             object model.
