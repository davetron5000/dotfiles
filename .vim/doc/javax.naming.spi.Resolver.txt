*javax.naming.spi.Resolver_Description*

This interface represents an "intermediate context" for name resolution. 

The Resolver interface contains methods that are implemented by contexts that do not support subtypes of Context, but which can act as intermediate contexts for resolution 
purposes. 

A Name parameter passed to any method is owned by the caller. The service provider will not modify the object or keep a reference to it. A ResolveResult object returned by any 
method is owned by the caller. The caller may subsequently modify it; the service provider may not. 



*javax.naming.spi.Resolver.resolveToClass(Name,Class<?extendsContext>)*

public |javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult| resolveToClass(
  javax.naming.Name name,
  java.lang.Class<? extends javax.naming.Context> contextType)
  throws |javax.naming.NamingException|
         
Partially resolves a name. Stops at the first context that is an instance of a given subtype of Context. 


    name - the name to resolve 
    contextType - the type of object to resolve. This should be a subtype of Context. 

    Returns: the object that was found, along with the unresolved suffix of name. Cannot be null. 

*javax.naming.spi.Resolver.resolveToClass(String,Class<?extendsContext>)*

public |javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult| resolveToClass(
  java.lang.String name,
  java.lang.Class<? extends javax.naming.Context> contextType)
  throws |javax.naming.NamingException|
         
Partially resolves a name. See (|javax.naming.spi.Resolver|) for details. 


    name - the name to resolve 
    contextType - the type of object to resolve. This should be a subtype of Context. 

    Returns: the object that was found, along with the unresolved suffix of name. Cannot be null.
