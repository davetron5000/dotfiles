|java.util.Iterator.hasNext()|Returns true if the iteration has more elements.

*java.util.Iterator_Description*

An iterator over a collection. Iterator takes the place of Enumeration in the Java collections framework. Iterators differ from enumerations in two ways: Iterators allow the 
caller to remove elements from the underlying collection during the iteration with well-defined semantics. Method names have been improved. 

This interface is a member of the <a href="/../guide/collections/index.html"> Java Collections Framework. 



*java.util.Iterator.hasNext()*

public boolean hasNext()

Returns true if the iteration has more elements. (In other words, returns true if next would return an element rather than throwing an exception.) 



    Returns: true if the iterator has more elements. 

*java.util.Iterator.next()*

public |E| next()

Returns the next element in the iteration. Calling this method repeatedly until the (|java.util.Iterator|) method returns false will return each element in the underlying 
collection exactly once. 



    Returns: the next element in the iteration. 

*java.util.Iterator.remove()*

public void remove()

Removes from the underlying collection the last element returned by the iterator (optional operation). This method can be called only once per call to next. The behavior of an 
iterator is unspecified if the underlying collection is modified while the iteration is in progress in any way other than by calling this method.
