*java.rmi.activation.ActivationMonitor_Description*

An ActivationMonitor is specific to an ActivationGroup and is obtained when a 
group is reported active via a call to ActivationSystem.activeGroup (this is 
done internally). An activation group is responsible for informing its 
ActivationMonitor when either: its objects become active or inactive, or the 
group as a whole becomes inactive. 


*java.rmi.activation.ActivationMonitor.activeObject(ActivationID,MarshalledObject)*

public void activeObject(
  java.rmi.activation.ActivationID id,
  java.rmi.MarshalledObject obj)
  throws |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         |java.rmi.activation.UnknownObjectException|
         
Informs that an object is now active. An ActivationGroup informs its monitor if 
an object in its group becomes active by other means than being activated 
directly (i.e., the object is registered and "activated" itself). 

    id - the active object's id 
    obj - the marshalled form of the object's stub 

*java.rmi.activation.ActivationMonitor.inactiveGroup(ActivationGroupID,long)*

public void inactiveGroup(
  java.rmi.activation.ActivationGroupID id,
  long incarnation)
  throws |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         |java.rmi.activation.UnknownGroupException|
         
Informs that the group is now inactive. The group will be recreated upon a 
subsequent request to activate an object within the group. A group becomes 
inactive when all objects in the group report that they are inactive. 

    id - the group's id 
    incarnation - the group's incarnation number 

*java.rmi.activation.ActivationMonitor.inactiveObject(ActivationID)*

public void inactiveObject(java.rmi.activation.ActivationID id)
  throws |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         |java.rmi.activation.UnknownObjectException|
         
An activation group calls its monitor's inactiveObject method when an object in 
its group becomes inactive (deactivates). An activation group discovers that an 
object (that it participated in activating) in its VM is no longer active, via 
calls to the activation group's inactiveObject method. 

The inactiveObject call informs the ActivationMonitor that the remote object 
reference it holds for the object with the activation identifier, id, is no 
longer valid. The monitor considers the reference associated with id as a stale 
reference. Since the reference is considered stale, a subsequent activate call 
for the same activation identifier results in re-activating the remote object. 

    id - the object's activation identifier
