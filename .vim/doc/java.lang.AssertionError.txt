*java.lang.AssertionError_Description*

Thrown to indicate that an assertion has failed. 

The seven one-argument public constructors provided by this class ensure that the assertion error returned by the invocation: 

new AssertionError(expression) 

has as its detail message the string conversion of expression (as defined in The Java Language Specification, Second Edition, 

Section 15.18.1.1), regardless of the type of expression. 



*java.lang.AssertionError()*

public AssertionError()

Constructs an AssertionError with no detail message. 


*java.lang.AssertionError(boolean)*

public AssertionError(boolean detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified boolean, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language Specification, Second 
Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(char)*

public AssertionError(char detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified char, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language Specification, Second Edition, 
Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(double)*

public AssertionError(double detailMessage)

Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(Object)*

public AssertionError(java.lang.Object detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified object, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language Specification, Second 
Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

If the specified object is an instance of Throwable, it becomes the cause of the newly constructed assertion error.
