*java.lang.AssertionError_Description*

Thrown to indicate that an assertion has failed. 

The seven one-argument public constructors provided by this class ensure that 
the assertion error returned by the invocation: 

new AssertionError(expression) 

has as its detail message the string conversion of expression (as defined in 
The Java Language Specification, Second Edition, 

Section 15.18.1.1), regardless of the type of expression. 


*java.lang.AssertionError()*

public AssertionError()

Constructs an AssertionError with no detail message. 


*java.lang.AssertionError(boolean)*

public AssertionError(boolean detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
boolean, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language 
Specification, Second Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(char)*

public AssertionError(char detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
char, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language 
Specification, Second Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(double)*

public AssertionError(double detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
double, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language 
Specification, Second Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(float)*

public AssertionError(float detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
float, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language 
Specification, Second Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(int)*

public AssertionError(int detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
int, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language 
Specification, Second Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(long)*

public AssertionError(long detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
long, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language 
Specification, Second Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

    detailMessage - value to be used in constructing detail message 

*java.lang.AssertionError(Object)*

public AssertionError(java.lang.Object detailMessage)

Constructs an AssertionError with its detail message derived from the specified 
object, which is converted to a string as defined in The Java Language 
Specification, Second Edition, Section 15.18.1.1. 

If the specified object is an instance of Throwable, it becomes the cause of 
the newly constructed assertion error.
