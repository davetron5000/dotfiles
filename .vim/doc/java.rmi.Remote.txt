*java.rmi.Remote_Description*

The Remote interface serves to identify interfaces whose methods may be invoked 
from a non-local virtual machine. Any object that is a remote object must 
directly or indirectly implement this interface. Only those methods specified 
in a "remote interface", an interface that extends java.rmi.Remote are 
available remotely. 

Implementation classes can implement any number of remote interfaces and can 
extend other remote implementation classes. RMI provides some convenience 
classes that remote object implementations can extend which facilitate remote 
object creation. These classes are java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject and 
java.rmi.activation.Activatable. 

For complete details on RMI, see the RMI Specification which describes the RMI 
API and system.
