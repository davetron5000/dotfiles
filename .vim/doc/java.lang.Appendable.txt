*java.lang.Appendable_Methods*
|java.lang.Appendable.append(char)|Appends the specified character to this Appendable.
|java.lang.Appendable.append(CharSequence)|Appends the specified character sequence to this Appendable.
|java.lang.Appendable.append(CharSequence,int,int)|Appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this  Appendable.

*java.lang.Appendable_Description*

An object to which char sequences and values can be appended. The Appendable interface must be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to receive formatted output 
from a (|java.util.Formatter|) . 

The characters to be appended should be valid Unicode characters as described in Unicode Character Representation. Note that supplementary characters may be composed of multiple 
16-bit char values. 

Appendables are not necessarily safe for multithreaded access. Thread safety is the responsibility of classes that extend and implement this interface. 

Since this interface may be implemented by existing classes with different styles of error handling there is no guarantee that errors will be propagated to the invoker. 



*java.lang.Appendable.append(char)*

public |java.lang.Appendable| append(char c)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Appends the specified character to this Appendable. 


    c - The character to append 

    Returns: A reference to this Appendable 

*java.lang.Appendable.append(CharSequence)*

public |java.lang.Appendable| append(java.lang.CharSequence csq)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Appends the specified character sequence to this Appendable. 

Depending on which class implements the character sequence csq, the entire sequence may not be appended. For instance, if csq is a (|java.nio.CharBuffer|) then the subsequence to 
append is defined by the buffer's position and limit. 


    csq - The character sequence to append. If csq is null, then the four characters "null" are appended to this Appendable. 

    Returns: A reference to this Appendable 

*java.lang.Appendable.append(CharSequence,int,int)*

public |java.lang.Appendable| append(
  java.lang.CharSequence csq,
  int start,
  int end)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this Appendable. 

An invocation of this method of the form out.append(csq, start, end) when csq is not null, behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation 



out.append(csq.subSequence(start, end)) 


    csq - The character sequence from which a subsequence will be appended. If csq is null, then characters will be appended as if csq contained the four characters "null". 
    start - The index of the first character in the subsequence 
    end - The index of the character following the last character in the subsequence 

    Returns: A reference to this Appendable
