*java.lang.Appendable_Description*

An object to which char sequences and values can be appended. The Appendable 
interface must be implemented by any class whose instances are intended to 
receive formatted output from a (|java.util.Formatter|) . 

The characters to be appended should be valid Unicode characters as described 
in Unicode Character Representation. Note that supplementary characters may be 
composed of multiple 16-bit char values. 

Appendables are not necessarily safe for multithreaded access. Thread safety is 
the responsibility of classes that extend and implement this interface. 

Since this interface may be implemented by existing classes with different 
styles of error handling there is no guarantee that errors will be propagated 
to the invoker. 


*java.lang.Appendable.append(char)*

public |java.lang.Appendable| append(char c)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Appends the specified character to this Appendable. 

    c - The character to append 

    Returns: A reference to this Appendable 
*java.lang.Appendable.append(CharSequence)*

public |java.lang.Appendable| append(java.lang.CharSequence csq)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Appends the specified character sequence to this Appendable. 

Depending on which class implements the character sequence csq, the entire 
sequence may not be appended. For instance, if csq is a (|java.nio.CharBuffer|) 
then the subsequence to append is defined by the buffer's position and limit. 

    csq - The character sequence to append. If csq is null, then the four characters 
       "null" are appended to this Appendable. 

    Returns: A reference to this Appendable 
*java.lang.Appendable.append(CharSequence,int,int)*

public |java.lang.Appendable| append(
  java.lang.CharSequence csq,
  int start,
  int end)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Appends a subsequence of the specified character sequence to this Appendable. 

An invocation of this method of the form out.append(csq, start, end) when csq 
is not null, behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation 



out.append(csq.subSequence(start, end)) 

    csq - The character sequence from which a subsequence will be appended. If csq is 
       null, then characters will be appended as if csq contained the four 
       characters "null". 
    start - The index of the first character in the subsequence 
    end - The index of the character following the last character in the subsequence 

    Returns: A reference to this Appendable
