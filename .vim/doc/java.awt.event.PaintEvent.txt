*java.awt.event.PaintEvent_Description*

The component-level paint event. This event is a special type which is used to ensure that paint/update method calls are serialized along with the other events delivered from the 
event queue. This event is not designed to be used with the Event Listener model; programs should continue to override paint/update methods in order render themselves properly. 



*int_java.awt.event.PaintEvent.PAINT*

The paint event type. 


*int_java.awt.event.PaintEvent.PAINT_FIRST*

Marks the first integer id for the range of paint event ids. 


*int_java.awt.event.PaintEvent.PAINT_LAST*

Marks the last integer id for the range of paint event ids. 


*int_java.awt.event.PaintEvent.UPDATE*

The update event type. 



*java.awt.event.PaintEvent(Component,int,Rectangle)*

public PaintEvent(
  java.awt.Component source,
  int id,
  java.awt.Rectangle updateRect)

Constructs a PaintEvent object with the specified source component and type. Note that passing in an invalid id results in unspecified behavior. This method throws an 
IllegalArgumentException if source is null. 

    source - the object where the event originated 
    id - the event type 
    updateRect - the rectangle area which needs to be repainted 

*java.awt.event.PaintEvent.getUpdateRect()*

public |java.awt.Rectangle| getUpdateRect()

Returns the rectangle representing the area which needs to be repainted in response to this event. 



*java.awt.event.PaintEvent.paramString()*

public |java.lang.String| paramString()





*java.awt.event.PaintEvent.setUpdateRect(Rectangle)*

public void setUpdateRect(java.awt.Rectangle updateRect)

Sets the rectangle representing the area which needs to be repainted in response to this event. 


    updateRect - the rectangle area which needs to be repainted
