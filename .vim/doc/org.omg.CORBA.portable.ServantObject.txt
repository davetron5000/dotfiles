*org.omg.CORBA.portable.ServantObject_Description*

This class is part of the local stub API, the purpose of which is to provide 
high performance calls for collocated clients and servers (i.e. clients and 
servers residing in the same Java VM). The local stub API is supported via 
three additional methods on ObjectImpl and Delegate. ORB vendors may subclass 
this class to return additional request state that may be required by their 
implementations.
