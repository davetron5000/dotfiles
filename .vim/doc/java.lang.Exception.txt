*java.lang.Exception_Description*

The class Exception and its subclasses are a form of Throwable that indicates 
conditions that a reasonable application might want to catch. 


*java.lang.Exception()*

public Exception()

Constructs a new exception with null as its detail message. The cause is not 
initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to 
(|java.lang.Exception|) . 


*java.lang.Exception(String)*

public Exception(java.lang.String message)

Constructs a new exception with the specified detail message. The cause is not 
initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to 
(|java.lang.Exception|) . 

    message - the detail message. The detail message is saved for later retrieval by the 
       {@link #getMessage()} method. 

*java.lang.Exception(String,Throwable)*

public Exception(
  java.lang.String message,
  java.lang.Throwable cause)

Constructs a new exception with the specified detail message and cause. Note 
that the detail message associated with cause is not automatically incorporated 
in this exception's detail message. 

    message - the detail message (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link 
       #getMessage()} method). 
    cause - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link #getCause()} 
       method). (A null value is permitted, and indicates that the cause is 
       nonexistent or unknown.) 

*java.lang.Exception(Throwable)*

public Exception(java.lang.Throwable cause)

Constructs a new exception with the specified cause and a detail message of 
(cause==null ? null : cause.toString()) (which typically contains the class and 
detail message of cause). This constructor is useful for exceptions that are 
little more than wrappers for other throwables (for example, 
(|java.security.PrivilegedActionException|) ). 

    cause - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link #getCause()} 
       method). (A null value is permitted, and indicates that the cause is 
       nonexistent or unknown.)
