*org.omg.CORBA.Policy_Description*

Interfaces derived from the Policy interface allow an ORB or CORBA service 
access to certain choices that affect its operation. This information is 
accessed in a structured manner using interfaces derived from the Policy 
interface defined in the CORBA module. A CORBA service does not have to use 
this method of accessing operating options, but may choose to do so. The 
Security Service in particular uses this technique for associating Security 
Policy with objects in the system. An interface generated by the IDL-to-Java 
compiler. org/omg/CORBA/Policy.java Generated by the IDL-to-Java compiler
