*javax.persistence.OrderBy_Description*

This annotation specifies the ordering of the elements of a collection valued 
association at the point when the association is retrieved. 

The syntax of the value ordering element is an orderby_list, as follows: 



orderby_list::= orderby_item [,orderby_item]* orderby_item::= 
property_or_field_name [ASC | DESC] 

If ASC or DESC is not specified, ASC (ascending order) is assumed. 

If the ordering element is not specified, ordering by the primary key of the 
associated entity is assumed. 

The property or field name must correspond to that of a persistent property or 
field of the associated class. The properties or fields used in the ordering 
must correspond to columns for which comparison operators are supported. 



Example: 

Entity public class Course { ... ManyToMany OrderBy("lastname ASC") public List 
getStudents() {...}; ... } 

Entity public class Student { ... ManyToMany(mappedBy="students") OrderBy // PK 
is assumed public List getCourses() {...}; ... }
