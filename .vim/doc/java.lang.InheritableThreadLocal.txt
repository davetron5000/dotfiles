*java.lang.InheritableThreadLocal_Description*

This class extends ThreadLocal to provide inheritance of values from parent 
thread to child thread: when a child thread is created, the child receives 
initial values for all inheritable thread-local variables for which the parent 
has values. Normally the child's values will be identical to the parent's; 
however, the child's value can be made an arbitrary function of the parent's by 
overriding the childValue method in this class. 

Inheritable thread-local variables are used in preference to ordinary 
thread-local variables when the per-thread-attribute being maintained in the 
variable (e.g., User ID, Transaction ID) must be automatically transmitted to 
any child threads that are created.

*java.lang.InheritableThreadLocal.childValue(T)*

protected |java.lang.Object| childValue(java.lang.Object parentValue)

Computes the child's initial value for this inheritable thread-local variable 
as a function of the parent's value at the time the child thread is created. 
This method is called from within the parent thread before the child is 
started. 

This method merely returns its input argument, and should be overridden if a 
different behavior is desired. 

    parentValue - the parent thread's value 

    Returns: the child thread's initial value
