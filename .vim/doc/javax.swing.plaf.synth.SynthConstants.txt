*javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthConstants_Description*

Constants used by Synth. Not all Components support all states. A Component 
will at least be in one of the primary states. That is, the return value from 
SynthContext.getComponentState() will at least be one of ENABLED, MOUSE_OVER, 
PRESSED or DISABLED, and may also contain FOCUSED, SELECTED or DEFAULT. 


*int_javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthConstants.DEFAULT*

Constants used by Synth. Not all Components support all states. A Component 
will at least be in one of the primary states. That is, the return value from 
SynthContext.getComponentState() will at least be one of ENABLED, MOUSE_OVER, 
PRESSED or DISABLED, and may also contain FOCUSED, SELECTED or DEFAULT. 


*int_javax.swing.plaf.synth.SynthConstants.DISABLED*
