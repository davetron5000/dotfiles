*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream_Constructors*
|java.util.zip.ZipInputStream(InputStream)|Creates a new ZIP input stream.

*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream_Methods*
|java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.available()|Returns 0 after EOF has reached for the current entry data,  otherwise always return 1.
|java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.close()|Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated  with the stream.
|java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.closeEntry()|Closes the current ZIP entry and positions the stream for reading the  next entry.
|java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.createZipEntry(String)|Creates a new ZipEntry object for the specified  entry name.
|java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.getNextEntry()|Reads the next ZIP file entry and positions the stream at the  beginning of the entry data.
|java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.read(byte[],int,int)|Reads from the current ZIP entry into an array of bytes.
|java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.skip(long)|Skips specified number of bytes in the current ZIP entry.

*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream_Description*

This class implements an input stream filter for reading files in the ZIP file format. Includes support for both compressed and uncompressed entries. 



*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream(InputStream)*

public ZipInputStream(java.io.InputStream in)

Creates a new ZIP input stream. 

    in - the actual input stream 

*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.available()*

public int available()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Returns 0 after EOF has reached for the current entry data, otherwise always return 1. 

Programs should not count on this method to return the actual number of bytes that could be read without blocking. 



    Returns: 1 before EOF and 0 after EOF has reached for current entry. 

*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.close()*

public void close()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Closes this input stream and releases any system resources associated with the stream. 



*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.closeEntry()*

public void closeEntry()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Closes the current ZIP entry and positions the stream for reading the next entry. 



*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.createZipEntry(String)*

protected |java.util.zip.ZipEntry| createZipEntry(java.lang.String name)

Creates a new ZipEntry object for the specified entry name. 


    name - the ZIP file entry name 

    Returns: the ZipEntry just created 

*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.getNextEntry()*

public |java.util.zip.ZipEntry| getNextEntry()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Reads the next ZIP file entry and positions the stream at the beginning of the entry data. 



    Returns: the next ZIP file entry, or null if there are no more entries 

*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.read(byte[],int,int)*

public int read(
  byte[] b,
  int off,
  int len)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Reads from the current ZIP entry into an array of bytes. Blocks until some input is available. 


    b - the buffer into which the data is read 
    off - the start offset of the data 
    len - the maximum number of bytes read 

    Returns: the actual number of bytes read, or -1 if the end of the entry is reached 

*java.util.zip.ZipInputStream.skip(long)*

public long skip(long n)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Skips specified number of bytes in the current ZIP entry. 


    n - the number of bytes to skip 

    Returns: the actual number of bytes skipped
