*java.lang.RuntimeException_Description*

RuntimeException is the superclass of those exceptions that can be thrown during the normal operation of the Java Virtual Machine. 

A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of RuntimeException that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught. 



*java.lang.RuntimeException()*

public RuntimeException()

Constructs a new runtime exception with null as its detail message. The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to (|java.lang.RuntimeException|) . 


*java.lang.RuntimeException(String)*

public RuntimeException(java.lang.String message)

Constructs a new runtime exception with the specified detail message. The cause is not initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to (|java.lang.RuntimeException|) 
. 

    message - the detail message. The detail message is saved for later retrieval by the {@link #getMessage()} method. 

*java.lang.RuntimeException(String,Throwable)*

public RuntimeException(
  java.lang.String message,
  java.lang.Throwable cause)

Constructs a new runtime exception with the specified detail message and cause. Note that the detail message associated with cause is not automatically incorporated in this 
runtime exception's detail message. 

    message - the detail message (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link #getMessage()} method). 
    cause - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link #getCause()} method). (A null value is permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or unknown.) 

*java.lang.RuntimeException(Throwable)*

public RuntimeException(java.lang.Throwable cause)

Constructs a new runtime exception with the specified cause and a detail message of (cause==null ? null : cause.toString()) (which typically contains the class and detail message 
of cause). This constructor is useful for runtime exceptions that are little more than wrappers for other throwables. 

    cause - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link #getCause()} method). (A null value is permitted, and indicates that the cause is nonexistent or unknown.)
