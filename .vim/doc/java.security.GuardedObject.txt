*java.security.GuardedObject_Description*

A GuardedObject is an object that is used to protect access to another object. 

A GuardedObject encapsulates a target object and a Guard object, such that 
access to the target object is possible only if the Guard object allows it. 
Once an object is encapsulated by a GuardedObject, access to that object is 
controlled by the getObject method, which invokes the checkGuard method on the 
Guard object that is guarding access. If access is not allowed, an exception is 
thrown. 


*java.security.GuardedObject(Object,Guard)*

public GuardedObject(
  java.lang.Object object,
  java.security.Guard guard)

Constructs a GuardedObject using the specified object and guard. If the Guard 
object is null, then no restrictions will be placed on who can access the 
object. 

    object - the object to be guarded. 
    guard - the Guard object that guards access to the object. 

*java.security.GuardedObject.getObject()*

public |java.lang.Object| getObject()
  throws |java.lang.SecurityException|
         
Retrieves the guarded object, or throws an exception if access to the guarded 
object is denied by the guard. 


    Returns: the guarded object.
