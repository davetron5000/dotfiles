*javax.swing.JTree.EmptySelectionModel_Description*

EmptySelectionModel is a TreeSelectionModel that does not allow anything to be 
selected. 

Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future 
Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term 
storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 
1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the 
java.beans package. Please see (|java.beans.XMLEncoder|) .
