*java.nio.IntBuffer_Description*

An int buffer. 

This class defines four categories of operations upon int buffers: 



Absolute and relative </code><i>get</i><code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) and </code><i>put</i><code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) methods that read and write single ints; 

Relative </code><i>bulk get</i><code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) methods that transfer contiguous sequences of ints from this buffer into an array; and 

Relative </code><i>bulk put</i><code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) methods that transfer contiguous sequences of ints from an int array or some other int buffer into this buffer;and 

Methods for </code>compacting<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) , </code>duplicating<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) , and </code>slicing<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) a int buffer. 



Int buffers can be created either by </code><i>allocation</i><code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) , which allocates space for the buffer's 

content, by </code><i>wrapping</i><code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) an existing int array into a buffer, or by creating a view of an existing byte buffer 

Like a byte buffer, a int buffer is either direct or non-direct. A int buffer created via the wrap methods of this class will be non-direct. A int buffer created as a view of a 
byte buffer will be direct if, and only if, the byte buffer itself is direct. Whether or not a int buffer is direct may be determined by invoking the 
isDirect(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) method. 

Methods in this class that do not otherwise have a value to return are specified to return the buffer upon which they are invoked. This allows method invocations to be chained. 



*java.nio.IntBuffer.allocate(int)*

public static |java.nio.IntBuffer| allocate(int capacity)

Allocates a new int buffer. 

The new buffer's position will be zero, its limit will be its capacity, and its mark will be undefined. It will have a </code>backing array<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) , and its 
</code>array offset<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) will be zero. 


    capacity - The new buffer's capacity, in ints 

    Returns: The new int buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.array()*

public final int[] array()

Returns the int array that backs this buffer(optional operation). 

Modifications to this buffer's content will cause the returned array's content to be modified, and vice versa. 

Invoke the hasArray(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) method before invoking this method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing array. 



    Returns: The array that backs this buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.arrayOffset()*

public final int arrayOffset()

Returns the offset within this buffer's backing array of the first element of the buffer(optional operation). 

If this buffer is backed by an array then buffer position p corresponds to array index p+arrayOffset(). 

Invoke the hasArray(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) method before invoking this method in order to ensure that this buffer has an accessible backing array. 



    Returns: The offset within this buffer's array of the first element of the buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.asReadOnlyBuffer()*

public abstract |java.nio.IntBuffer| asReadOnlyBuffer()

Creates a new, read-only int buffer that shares this buffer's content. 

The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer. Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer; the new buffer itself, however, will be read-only 
and will not allow the shared content to be modified. The two buffers' position, limit, and mark values will be independent. 

The new buffer's capacity, limit, position, and mark values will be identical to those of this buffer. 

If this buffer is itself read-only then this method behaves in exactly the same way as the duplicate(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) method. 



    Returns: The new, read-only int buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.compact()*

public abstract |java.nio.IntBuffer| compact()

Compacts this buffer(optional operation). 

The ints between the buffer's current position and its limit, if any, are copied to the beginning of the buffer. That is, the int at index p=position() is copied to index zero, 
the int at index p+1 is copied to index one, and so forth until the int at index limit()-1 is copied to index n=limit()-1-p. The buffer's position is then set to n+1 and its limit 
is set to its capacity. The mark, if defined, is discarded. 

The buffer's position is set to the number of ints copied, rather than to zero, so that an invocation of this method can be followed immediately by an invocation of another 
relative put method. 



    Returns: 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.compareTo(IntBuffer)*

public int compareTo(java.nio.IntBuffer that)

Compares this buffer to another. 

Two int buffers are compared by comparing their sequences of remaining elements lexicographically, without regard to the starting position of each sequence within its 
corresponding buffer. 

A int buffer is not comparable to any other type of object. 



    Returns: A negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as this buffer is less than, equal to, or greater than the given buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.duplicate()*

public abstract |java.nio.IntBuffer| duplicate()

Creates a new int buffer that shares this buffer's content. 

The content of the new buffer will be that of this buffer. Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers' position, limit, 
and mark values will be independent. 

The new buffer's capacity, limit, position, and mark values will be identical to those of this buffer. The new buffer will be direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct, and it 
will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only. 



    Returns: The new int buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object ob)

Tells whether or not this buffer is equal to another object. 

Two int buffers are equal if, and only if, 



They have the same element type, 

They have the same number of remaining elements, and 

The two sequences of remaining elements, considered independently of their starting positions, are pointwise equal. 



A int buffer is not equal to any other type of object. 


    ob - The object to which this buffer is to be compared 

    Returns: true if, and only if, this buffer is equal to the given object 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.get()*

public abstract int get()

Relative get method. Reads the int at this buffer's current position, and then increments the position. 



    Returns: The int at the buffer's current position 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.get(int)*

public abstract int get(int index)

Absolute get method. Reads the int at the given index. 


    index - The index from which the int will be read 

    Returns: The int at the given index 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.get(int[])*

public |java.nio.IntBuffer| get(int[] dst)

Relative bulk get method. 

This method transfers ints from this buffer into the given destination array. An invocation of this method of the form src.get(a) behaves in exactly the same way as the invocation 



src.get(a, 0, a.length) 



    Returns: 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.get(int[],int,int)*

public |java.nio.IntBuffer| get(
  int[] dst,
  int offset,
  int length)

Relative bulk get method. 

This method transfers ints from this buffer into the given destination array. If there are fewer ints remaining in the buffer than are required to satisfy the request, that is, if 
length>remaining(), then no ints are transferred and a (|java.nio.BufferUnderflowException|) is thrown. 

Otherwise, this method copies length ints from this buffer into the given array, starting at the current position of this buffer and at the given offset in the array. The position 
of this buffer is then incremented by length. 

In other words, an invocation of this method of the form src.get(dst,off,len) has exactly the same effect as the loop 



for (int i = off; i 


    dst - The array into which ints are to be written 
    offset - The offset within the array of the first int to be written; must be non-negative and no larger than dst.length 
    length - The maximum number of ints to be written to the given array; must be non-negative and no larger than dst.length - offset 

    Returns: 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.hasArray()*

public final boolean hasArray()

Tells whether or not this buffer is backed by an accessible int array. 

If this method returns true then the array(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) and arrayOffset(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) methods may safely be invoked. 



    Returns: true if, and only if, this buffer is backed by an array and is not read-only 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns the current hash code of this buffer. 

The hash code of a int buffer depends only upon its remaining elements; that is, upon the elements from position() up to, and including, the element at limit()-1. 

Because buffer hash codes are content-dependent, it is inadvisable to use buffers as keys in hash maps or similar data structures unless it is known that their contents will not 
change. 



    Returns: The current hash code of this buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.isDirect()*

public abstract boolean isDirect()

Tells whether or not this int buffer is direct. 



    Returns: true if, and only if, this buffer is direct 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.order()*

public abstract |java.nio.ByteOrder| order()

Retrieves this buffer's byte order. 

The byte order of a int buffer created by allocation or by wrapping an existing int array is the </code>native order<code>(|java.nio.ByteOrder|) of the underlying hardware. The 
byte order of a int buffer created as a view of a byte buffer is that of the byte buffer at the moment that the view is created. 



    Returns: This buffer's byte order 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.put(int)*

public abstract |java.nio.IntBuffer| put(int i)

Relative put method(optional operation). 

Writes the given int into this buffer at the current position, and then increments the position. 


    i - The int to be written 

    Returns: 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.put(int[])*

public final |java.nio.IntBuffer| put(int[] src)

Relative bulk put method(optional operation). 

This method transfers the entire content of the given source int array into this buffer. An invocation of this method of the form dst.put(a) behaves in exactly the same way as the 
invocation 



dst.put(a, 0, a.length) 



    Returns: 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.put(int[],int,int)*

public |java.nio.IntBuffer| put(
  int[] src,
  int offset,
  int length)

Relative bulk put method(optional operation). 

This method transfers ints into this buffer from the given source array. If there are more ints to be copied from the array than remain in this buffer, that is, if 
length>remaining(), then no ints are transferred and a (|java.nio.BufferOverflowException|) is thrown. 

Otherwise, this method copies length ints from the given array into this buffer, starting at the given offset in the array and at the current position of this buffer. The position 
of this buffer is then incremented by length. 

In other words, an invocation of this method of the form dst.put(src,off,len) has exactly the same effect as the loop 



for (int i = off; i 


    src - The array from which ints are to be read 
    offset - The offset within the array of the first int to be read; must be non-negative and no larger than array.length 
    length - The number of ints to be read from the given array; must be non-negative and no larger than array.length - offset 

    Returns: 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.put(IntBuffer)*

public |java.nio.IntBuffer| put(java.nio.IntBuffer src)

Relative bulk put method(optional operation). 

This method transfers the ints remaining in the given source buffer into this buffer. If there are more ints remaining in the source buffer than in this buffer, that is, if 
src.remaining()>remaining(), then no ints are transferred and a (|java.nio.BufferOverflowException|) is thrown. 

Otherwise, this method copies n=src.remaining() ints from the given buffer into this buffer, starting at each buffer's current position. The positions of both buffers are then 
incremented by n. 

In other words, an invocation of this method of the form dst.put(src) has exactly the same effect as the loop 



while (src.hasRemaining()) dst.put(src.get()); 

except that it first checks that there is sufficient space in this buffer and it is potentially much more efficient. 


    src - The source buffer from which ints are to be read; must not be this buffer 

    Returns: 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.put(int,int)*

public abstract |java.nio.IntBuffer| put(
  int index,
  int i)

Absolute put method(optional operation). 

Writes the given int into this buffer at the given index. 


    index - The index at which the int will be written 
    i - The int value to be written 

    Returns: 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.slice()*

public abstract |java.nio.IntBuffer| slice()

Creates a new int buffer whose content is a shared subsequence of this buffer's content. 

The content of the new buffer will start at this buffer's current position. Changes to this buffer's content will be visible in the new buffer, and vice versa; the two buffers' 
position, limit, and mark values will be independent. 

The new buffer's position will be zero, its capacity and its limit will be the number of ints remaining in this buffer, and its mark will be undefined. The new buffer will be 
direct if, and only if, this buffer is direct, and it will be read-only if, and only if, this buffer is read-only. 



    Returns: The new int buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Returns a string summarizing the state of this buffer. 



    Returns: A summary string 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.wrap(int[])*

public static |java.nio.IntBuffer| wrap(int[] array)

Wraps a int array into a buffer. 

The new buffer will be backed by the given int array; that is, modifications to the buffer will cause the array to be modified and vice versa. The new buffer's capacity and limit 
will be array.length, its position will be zero, and its mark will be undefined. Its </code>backing array<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) will be the given array, and its </code>array 
offset<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) will be zero. 


    array - The array that will back this buffer 

    Returns: The new int buffer 

*java.nio.IntBuffer.wrap(int[],int,int)*

public static |java.nio.IntBuffer| wrap(
  int[] array,
  int offset,
  int length)

Wraps a int array into a buffer. 

The new buffer will be backed by the given int array; that is, modifications to the buffer will cause the array to be modified and vice versa. The new buffer's capacity will be 
array.length, its position will be offset, its limit will be offset + length, and its mark will be undefined. Its </code>backing array<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) will be the 
given array, and its </code>array offset<code>(|java.nio.IntBuffer|) will be zero. 


    array - The array that will back the new buffer 
    offset - The offset of the subarray to be used; must be non-negative and no larger than array.length. The new buffer's position will be set to this value. 
    length - The length of the subarray to be used; must be non-negative and no larger than array.length - offset. The new buffer's limit will be set to offset + length. 

    Returns: The new int buffer
