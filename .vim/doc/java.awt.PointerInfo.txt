*java.awt.PointerInfo_Description*

A class that describes the pointer position. It provides the GraphicsDevice 
where the pointer is and the Point that represents the coordinates of the 
pointer. 

Instances of this class should be obtained via (|java.awt.MouseInfo|) . The 
PointerInfo instance is not updated dynamically as the mouse moves. To get the 
updated location, you must call (|java.awt.MouseInfo|) again. 


*java.awt.PointerInfo.getDevice()*

public |java.awt.GraphicsDevice| getDevice()

Returns the GraphicsDevice where the mouse pointer was at the moment this 
PointerInfo was created. 


    Returns: GraphicsDevice corresponding to the pointer 
*java.awt.PointerInfo.getLocation()*

public |java.awt.Point| getLocation()

Returns the Point that represents the coordinates of the pointer on the screen. 
See (|java.awt.MouseInfo|) for more information about coordinate calculation 
for multiscreen systems.
