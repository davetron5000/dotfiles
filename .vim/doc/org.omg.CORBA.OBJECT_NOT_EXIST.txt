*org.omg.CORBA.OBJECT_NOT_EXIST_Description*

Exception raised whenever an invocation on a deleted object was performed. It 
is an authoritative "hard" fault report. Anyone receiving it is allowed (even 
expected) to delete all copies of this object reference and to perform other 
appropriate "final recovery" style procedures. Bridges forward this exception 
to clients, also destroying any records they may hold (for example, proxy 
objects used in reference translation). The clients could in turn purge any of 
their own data structures. 

It contains a minor code, which gives more detailed information about what 
caused the exception, and a completion status. It may also contain a string 
describing the exception. 

See the section Minor Code Meanings to see the minor codes for this exception.
