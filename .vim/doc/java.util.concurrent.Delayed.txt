*java.util.concurrent.Delayed_Description*

A mix-in style interface for marking objects that should be acted upon after a 
given delay. 

An implementation of this interface must define a compareTo method that 
provides an ordering consistent with its getDelay method. 


*java.util.concurrent.Delayed.getDelay(TimeUnit)*

public long getDelay(java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit unit)

Returns the remaining delay associated with this object, in the given time 
unit. 

    unit - the time unit 

    Returns: the remaining delay; zero or negative values indicate that the delay has 
             already elapsed
