*java.lang.annotation.Inherited_Description*

Indicates that an annotation type is automatically inherited. If an Inherited 
meta-annotation is present on an annotation type declaration, and the user 
queries the annotation type on a class declaration, and the class declaration 
has no annotation for this type, then the class's superclass will automatically 
be queried for the annotation type. This process will be repeated until an 
annotation for this type is found, or the top of the class hierarchy (Object) 
is reached. If no superclass has an annotation for this type, then the query 
will indicate that the class in question has no such annotation. 

Note that this meta-annotation type has no effect if the annotated type is used 
to annotate anything other than a class. Note also that this meta-annotation 
only causes annotations to be inherited from superclasses; annotations on 
implemented interfaces have no effect.
