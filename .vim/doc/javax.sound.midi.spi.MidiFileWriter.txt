*javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter_Description*

A MidiFileWriter supplies MIDI file-writing services. Classes that implement 
this interface can write one or more types of MIDI file from a 
(|javax.sound.midi.Sequence|) object. 


*javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter()*

public MidiFileWriter()




*javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter.getMidiFileTypes()*

public abstract int getMidiFileTypes()

Obtains the set of MIDI file types for which file writing support is provided 
by this file writer. 


    Returns: array of file types. If no file types are supported, an array of length 0 is 
             returned. 
*javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter.getMidiFileTypes(Sequence)*

public abstract int getMidiFileTypes(javax.sound.midi.Sequence sequence)

Obtains the file types that this file writer can write from the sequence 
specified. 

    sequence - the sequence for which MIDI file type support is queried 

    Returns: array of file types. If no file types are supported, returns an array of length 
             0. 
*javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter.isFileTypeSupported(int)*

public boolean isFileTypeSupported(int fileType)

Indicates whether file writing support for the specified MIDI file type is 
provided by this file writer. 

    fileType - the file type for which write capabilities are queried 

    Returns: true if the file type is supported, otherwise false 
*javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter.isFileTypeSupported(int,Sequence)*

public boolean isFileTypeSupported(
  int fileType,
  javax.sound.midi.Sequence sequence)

Indicates whether a MIDI file of the file type specified can be written from 
the sequence indicated. 

    fileType - the file type for which write capabilities are queried 
    sequence - the sequence for which file writing support is queried 

    Returns: true if the file type is supported for this sequence, otherwise false 
*javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter.write(Sequence,int,File)*

public abstract int write(
  javax.sound.midi.Sequence in,
  int fileType,
  java.io.File out)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a stream of bytes representing a MIDI file of the file type indicated to 
the external file provided. 

    in - sequence containing MIDI data to be written to the external file 
    fileType - type of the file to be written to the external file 
    out - external file to which the file data should be written 

    Returns: the number of bytes written to the file 
*javax.sound.midi.spi.MidiFileWriter.write(Sequence,int,OutputStream)*

public abstract int write(
  javax.sound.midi.Sequence in,
  int fileType,
  java.io.OutputStream out)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a stream of bytes representing a MIDI file of the file type indicated to 
the output stream provided. 

    in - sequence containing MIDI data to be written to the file 
    fileType - type of the file to be written to the output stream 
    out - stream to which the file data should be written 

    Returns: the number of bytes written to the output stream
