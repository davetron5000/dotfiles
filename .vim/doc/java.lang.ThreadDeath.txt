*java.lang.ThreadDeath_Description*

An instance of ThreadDeath is thrown in the victim thread when the stop method 
with zero arguments in class Thread is called. 

An application should catch instances of this class only if it must clean up 
after being terminated asynchronously. If ThreadDeath is caught by a method, it 
is important that it be rethrown so that the thread actually dies. 

The top-level error handler does not print out a message if ThreadDeath is 
never caught. 

The class ThreadDeath is specifically a subclass of Error rather than 
Exception, even though it is a "normal occurrence", because many applications 
catch all occurrences of Exception and then discard the exception.
