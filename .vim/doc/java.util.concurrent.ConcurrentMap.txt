|java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap.putIfAbsent(K,V)|If the specified key is not already associated  with a value, associate it with the given value.
|java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap.remove(Object,Object)|Remove entry for key only if currently mapped to given value.

|java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap.replace(K,V,V)|Replace entry for key only if currently mapped to given value.

*java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap_Description*

A (|java.util.Map|) providing additional atomic putIfAbsent, remove, and replace methods. 

This interface is a member of the <a href="/../guide/collections/index.html"> Java Collections Framework. 



*java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap.putIfAbsent(K,V)*

public |V| putIfAbsent(
  K key,
  V value)

If the specified key is not already associated with a value, associate it with the given value. This is equivalent to 

if (!map.containsKey(key)) return map.put(key, value); else return map.get(key); 

Except that the action is performed atomically. 


    key - key with which the specified value is to be associated. 
    value - value to be associated with the specified key. 

    Returns: previous value associated with specified key, or null if there was no mapping for key. A null return can also indicate that the map previously associated null with the specified 
             key, if the implementation supports null values. 

*java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap.remove(Object,Object)*

public boolean remove(
  java.lang.Object key,
  java.lang.Object value)

Remove entry for key only if currently mapped to given value. Acts as 

if ((map.containsKey(key) map.get(key).equals(value)) { map.remove(key); return true; } else return false; 

except that the action is performed atomically. 


    key - key with which the specified value is associated. 
    value - value associated with the specified key. 

    Returns: true if the value was removed, false otherwise 

*java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap.replace(K,V)*

public |V| replace(
  K key,
  V value)

Replace entry for key only if currently mapped to some value. Acts as 

if ((map.containsKey(key)) { return map.put(key, value); } else return null; 

except that the action is performed atomically. 


    key - key with which the specified value is associated. 
    value - value to be associated with the specified key. 

    Returns: previous value associated with specified key, or null if there was no mapping for key. A null return can also indicate that the map previously associated null with the specified 
             key, if the implementation supports null values. 

*java.util.concurrent.ConcurrentMap.replace(K,V,V)*

public boolean replace(
  K key,
  V oldValue,
  V newValue)

Replace entry for key only if currently mapped to given value. Acts as 

if ((map.containsKey(key) map.get(key).equals(oldValue)) { map.put(key, newValue); return true; } else return false; 

except that the action is performed atomically. 


    key - key with which the specified value is associated. 
    oldValue - value expected to be associated with the specified key. 
    newValue - value to be associated with the specified key. 

    Returns: true if the value was replaced
