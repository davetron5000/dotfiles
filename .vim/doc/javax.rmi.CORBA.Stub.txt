*javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub_Description*

Base class from which all RMI-IIOP stubs must inherit. 


*javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub()*

public Stub()




*javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub.connect(ORB)*

public void connect(org.omg.CORBA.ORB orb)
  throws |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         
Connects this stub to an ORB. Required after the stub is deserialized but not 
after it is demarshalled by an ORB stream. If an unconnected stub is passed to 
an ORB stream for marshalling, it is implicitly connected to that ORB. 
Application code should not call this method directly, but should call the 
portable wrapper method (|javax.rmi.PortableRemoteObject|) . 

    orb - the ORB to connect to. 

*javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Compares two stubs for equality. Returns true when used to compare stubs that 
represent the same remote object, and false otherwise. 

    obj - the reference object with which to compare. 

    Returns: true if this object is the same as the obj argument; false otherwise. 
*javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns a hash code value for the object which is the same for all stubs that 
represent the same remote object. 


    Returns: the hash code value. 
*javax.rmi.CORBA.Stub.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Returns a string representation of this stub. Returns the same string for all 
stubs that represent the same remote object. 


    Returns: a string representation of this stub.
