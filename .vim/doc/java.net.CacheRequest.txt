*java.net.CacheRequest_Description*

Represents channels for storing resources in the ResponseCache. Instances of 
such a class provide an OutputStream object which is called by protocol 
handlers to store the resource data into the cache, and also an abort() method 
which allows a cache store operation to be interrupted and abandoned. If an 
IOException is encountered while reading the response or writing to the cache, 
the current cache store operation will be aborted.
