*java.io.DataInputStream_Description*

A data input stream lets an application read primitive Java data types from an underlying input stream in a machine-independent way. An application uses a data output stream to 
write data that can later be read by a data input stream. 



*java.io.DataInputStream(InputStream)*

public DataInputStream(java.io.InputStream in)

Creates a DataInputStream that uses the specified underlying InputStream. 

    in - the specified input stream 

*java.io.DataInputStream.read(byte[])*

public final int read(byte[] b)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Reads some number of bytes from the contained input stream and stores them into the buffer array b. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. This method blocks 
until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. 

If b is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. If the length of b is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If 
no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b. 

The first byte read is stored into element b[0], the next one into b[1], and so on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to the length of b. Let k be the number of bytes 
actually read; these bytes will be stored in elements b[0] through b[k-1], leaving elements b[k] through b[b.length-1] unaffected. 

If the first byte cannot be read for any reason other than end of file, then an IOException is thrown. In particular, an IOException is thrown if the input stream has been closed. 

The read(b) method has the same effect as: 

read(b, 0, b.length) 


    b - the buffer into which the data is read. 

    Returns: the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached. 

*java.io.DataInputStream.read(byte[],int,int)*

public final int read(
  byte[] b,
  int off,
  int len)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Reads up to len bytes of data from the contained input stream into an array of bytes. An attempt is made to read as many as len bytes, but a smaller number may be read, possibly 
zero. The number of bytes actually read is returned as an integer. 

This method blocks until input data is available, end of file is detected, or an exception is thrown. 

If b is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. 

If off is negative, or len is negative, or off+len is greater than the length of the array b, then an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. 

If len is zero, then no bytes are read and 0 is returned; otherwise, there is an attempt to read at least one byte. If no byte is available because the stream is at end of file, 
the value -1 is returned; otherwise, at least one byte is read and stored into b. 

The first byte read is stored into element b[off], the next one into b[off+1], and so on. The number of bytes read is, at most, equal to len. Let k be the number of bytes actually 
read; these bytes will be stored in elements b[off] through b[off+k-1], leaving elements b[off+k] through b[off+len-1] unaffected. 

In every case, elements b[0] through b[off] and elements b[off+len] through b[b.length-1] are unaffected. 

If the first byte cannot be read for any reason other than end of file, then an IOException is thrown. In particular, an IOException is thrown if the input stream has been closed. 


    b - the buffer into which the data is read. 
    off - the start offset of the data. 
    len - the maximum number of bytes read. 

    Returns: the total number of bytes read into the buffer, or -1 if there is no more data because the end of the stream has been reached.

    Deprecated: This method does not properly convert bytes to characters.
 As of JDK&nbsp;1.1, the preferred way to read lines of text is via the
 <code>BufferedReader.readLine()</code> method.  Programs that use the
 <code>DataInputStream</code> class to read lines can be converted to use
 the <code>BufferedReader</code> class by replacing code of the form:
 <blockquote><pre>
     DataInputStream d =&nbsp;new&nbsp;DataInputStream(in);
 </pre></blockquote>
 with:
 <blockquote><pre>
     BufferedReader d
          =&nbsp;new&nbsp;BufferedReader(new&nbsp;InputStreamReader(in));
 </pre></blockquote>


    Returns: the next line of text from this input stream.
