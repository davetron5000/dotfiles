*javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter_Description*

Provider for audio file writing services. Classes providing concrete 
implementations can write one or more types of audio file from an audio stream. 


*javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter()*

public AudioFileWriter()




*javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter.getAudioFileTypes()*

public abstract |javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat.Type| getAudioFileTypes()

Obtains the file types for which file writing support is provided by this audio 
file writer. 


    Returns: array of file types. If no file types are supported, an array of length 0 is 
             returned. 
*javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter.getAudioFileTypes(AudioInputStream)*

public abstract |javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat.Type| getAudioFileTypes(javax.sound.sampled.AudioInputStream stream)

Obtains the file types that this audio file writer can write from the audio 
input stream specified. 

    stream - the audio input stream for which audio file type support is queried 

    Returns: array of file types. If no file types are supported, an array of length 0 is 
             returned. 
*javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter.isFileTypeSupported(AudioFileFormat.Type)*

public boolean isFileTypeSupported(javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat.Type fileType)

Indicates whether file writing support for the specified file type is provided 
by this audio file writer. 

    fileType - the file type for which write capabilities are queried 

    Returns: true if the file type is supported, otherwise false 
*javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter.isFileTypeSupported(AudioFileFormat.Type,AudioInputStream)*

public boolean isFileTypeSupported(
  javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat.Type fileType,
  javax.sound.sampled.AudioInputStream stream)

Indicates whether an audio file of the type specified can be written from the 
audio input stream indicated. 

    fileType - file type for which write capabilities are queried 
    stream - for which file writing support is queried 

    Returns: true if the file type is supported for this audio input stream, otherwise false 
*javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter.write(AudioInputStream,AudioFileFormat.Type,File)*

public abstract int write(
  javax.sound.sampled.AudioInputStream stream,
  javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat.Type fileType,
  java.io.File out)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a stream of bytes representing an audio file of the file format 
indicated to the external file provided. 

    stream - the audio input stream containing audio data to be written to the file 
    fileType - file type to be written to the file 
    out - external file to which the file data should be written 

    Returns: the number of bytes written to the file 
*javax.sound.sampled.spi.AudioFileWriter.write(AudioInputStream,AudioFileFormat.Type,OutputStream)*

public abstract int write(
  javax.sound.sampled.AudioInputStream stream,
  javax.sound.sampled.AudioFileFormat.Type fileType,
  java.io.OutputStream out)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a stream of bytes representing an audio file of the file type indicated 
to the output stream provided. Some file types require that the length be 
written into the file header, and cannot be written from start to finish unless 
the length is known in advance. An attempt to write such a file type will fail 
with an IOException if the length in the audio file format is 
AudioSystem.NOT_SPECIFIED(|javax.sound.sampled.AudioSystem|) . 

    stream - the audio input stream containing audio data to be written to the output stream 
    fileType - file type to be written to the output stream 
    out - stream to which the file data should be written 

    Returns: the number of bytes written to the output stream
