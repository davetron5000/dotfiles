*javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterStateReason_Description*

Class PrinterStateReason is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that 
provides additional information about the printer's current state, i.e., 
information that augments the value of the printer's 
PrinterState(|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterState|) attribute. Class 
PrinterStateReason defines standard printer state reason values. A Print 
Service implementation only needs to report those printer state reasons which 
are appropriate for the particular implementation; it does not have to report 
every defined printer state reason. 

Instances of PrinterStateReason do not appear in a Print Service's attribute 
set directly. Rather, a 
PrinterStateReasons(|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterStateReasons|) 
attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set. The 
PrinterStateReasons(|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterStateReasons|) 
attribute contains zero, one, or more than one PrinterStateReason objects which 
pertain to the Print Service's status, and each PrinterStateReason object is 
associated with a Severity(|javax.print.attribute.standard.Severity|) level of 
REPORT (least severe), WARNING, or ERROR (most severe). The printer adds a 
PrinterStateReason object to the Print Service's 
PrinterStateReasons(|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterStateReasons|) 
attribute when the corresponding condition becomes true of the printer, and the 
printer removesthe PrinterStateReason object again when the corresponding 
condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Service's overall 
PrinterState(|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterState|) also changed. 

IPP Compatibility: The string values returned by each individual 
(|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterStateReason|) and associated 
(|javax.print.attribute.standard.Severity|) object's toString() methods, 
concatenated together with a hyphen ("-") in between, gives the IPP keyword 
value for a (|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterStateReasons|) . The 
category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name.

Class PrinterStateReason is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that 
provides additional information about the printer's current state, i.e., 
information that augments the value of the printer's 
PrinterState(|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterState|) attribute. Class 
PrinterStateReason defines standard printer state reason values. A Print 
Service implementation only needs to report those printer state reasons which 
are appropriate for the particular implementation; it does not have to report 
every defined printer state reason. 

Instances of PrinterStateReason do not appear in a Print Service's attribute 
set directly. Rather, a 
PrinterStateReasons(|javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterStateReasons|) 
attribute appears in the Print Service's attribute set. The
