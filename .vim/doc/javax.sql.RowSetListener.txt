*javax.sql.RowSetListener_Description*

An interface that must be implemented by a component that wants to be notified 
when a significant event happens in the life of a RowSet object. A component 
becomes a listener by being registered with a RowSet object via the method 
RowSet.addRowSetListener. How a registered component implements this interface 
determines what it does when it is notified of an event. 


*javax.sql.RowSetListener.cursorMoved(RowSetEvent)*

public void cursorMoved(javax.sql.RowSetEvent event)

Notifies registered listeners that a RowSet object's cursor has moved. 

The source of the event can be retrieved with the method event.getSource. 

    event - a RowSetEvent object that contains the RowSet object that is the source of the 
       event 

*javax.sql.RowSetListener.rowChanged(RowSetEvent)*

public void rowChanged(javax.sql.RowSetEvent event)

Notifies registered listeners that a RowSet object has had a change in one of 
its rows. 

The source of the event can be retrieved with the method event.getSource. 

    event - a RowSetEvent object that contains the RowSet object that is the source of the 
       event 

*javax.sql.RowSetListener.rowSetChanged(RowSetEvent)*

public void rowSetChanged(javax.sql.RowSetEvent event)

Notifies registered listeners that a RowSet object in the given RowSetEvent 
object has changed its entire contents. 

The source of the event can be retrieved with the method event.getSource. 

    event - a RowSetEvent object that contains the RowSet object that is the source of the 
       event
