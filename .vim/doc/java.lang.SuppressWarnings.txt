*java.lang.SuppressWarnings_Description*

Indicates that the named compiler warnings should be suppressed in the annotated element (and in all program elements contained in the annotated element). Note that the set of 
warnings suppressed in a given element is a superset of the warnings suppressed in all containing elements. For example, if you annotate a class to suppress one warning and 
annotate a method to suppress another, both warnings will be suppressed in the method. 

As a matter of style, programmers should always use this annotation on the most deeply nested element where it is effective. If you want to suppress a warning in a particular 
method, you should annotate that method rather than its class.
