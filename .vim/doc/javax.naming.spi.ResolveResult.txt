*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult_Description*

This class represents the result of resolution of a name. It contains the object to which name was resolved, and the portion of the name that has not been resolved. 

A ResolveResult instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a single ResolveResult instance should lock the 
object. 



*javax.naming.Name_javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult.remainingName*

Field containing the remaining name yet to be resolved. It can be null only when constructed using a subclass. Constructors should always initialize this. 


*java.lang.Object_javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult.resolvedObj*

Field containing the Object that was resolved to successfully. It can be null only when constructed using a subclass. Constructors should always initialize this. 



*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult()*

protected ResolveResult()

Constructs an instance of ResolveResult with the resolved object and remaining name both initialized to null. 


*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult(Object,Name)*

public ResolveResult(
  java.lang.Object robj,
  javax.naming.Name rname)

Constructs a new instance of ResolveResult consisting of the resolved Object and the remaining name. 

    robj - The non-null Object resolved to. 
    rname - The non-null remaining name that has yet to be resolved. 

*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult(Object,String)*

public ResolveResult(
  java.lang.Object robj,
  java.lang.String rcomp)

Constructs a new instance of ResolveResult consisting of the resolved object and the remaining unresolved component. 

    robj - The non-null object resolved to. 
    rcomp - The single remaining name component that has yet to be resolved. Cannot be null (but can be empty). 

*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult.appendRemainingComponent(String)*

public void appendRemainingComponent(java.lang.String name)

Adds a single component to the end of remaining name. 


    name - The component to add. Can be null. 

*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult.appendRemainingName(Name)*

public void appendRemainingName(javax.naming.Name name)

Adds components to the end of remaining name. 


    name - The components to add. Can be null. 

*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult.getRemainingName()*

public |javax.naming.Name| getRemainingName()

Retrieves the remaining unresolved portion of the name. 



    Returns: The remaining unresolved portion of the name. Cannot be null but empty OK. 

*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult.getResolvedObj()*

public |java.lang.Object| getResolvedObj()

Retrieves the Object to which resolution was successful. 



    Returns: The Object to which resolution was successful. Cannot be null. 

*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult.setRemainingName(Name)*

public void setRemainingName(javax.naming.Name name)

Sets the remaining name field of this result to name. A copy of name is made so that modifying the copy within this ResolveResult does not affect name and vice versa. 


    name - The name to set remaining name to. Cannot be null. 

*javax.naming.spi.ResolveResult.setResolvedObj(Object)*

public void setResolvedObj(java.lang.Object obj)

Sets the resolved Object field of this result to obj. 


    obj - The object to use for setting the resolved obj field. Cannot be null.
