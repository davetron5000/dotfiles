*javax.naming.directory.SearchResult_Description*

This class represents an item in the NamingEnumeration returned as a result of 
the DirContext.search() methods. 

A SearchResult instance is not synchronized against concurrent multithreaded 
access. Multiple threads trying to access and modify a single SearchResult 
instance should lock the object. 


*javax.naming.directory.SearchResult(String,Object,Attributes)*

public SearchResult(
  java.lang.String name,
  java.lang.Object obj,
  javax.naming.directory.Attributes attrs)

Constructs a search result using the result's name, its bound object, and its 
attributes. 

getClassName() will return the class name of obj (or null if obj is null) 
unless the class name has been explicitly set using setClassName(). 

    name - The non-null name of the search item. It is relative to the target context of 
       the search (which is named by the first parameter of the search() 
       method) 
    obj - The object bound to name. Can be null. 
    attrs - The attributes that were requested to be returned with this search item. Cannot 
       be null. 

*javax.naming.directory.SearchResult(String,Object,Attributes,boolean)*

public SearchResult(
  java.lang.String name,
  java.lang.Object obj,
  javax.naming.directory.Attributes attrs,
  boolean isRelative)

Constructs a search result using the result's name, its bound object, and its 
attributes, and whether the name is relative. 

getClassName() will return the class name of obj (or null if obj is null) 
unless the class name has been explicitly set using setClassName() 

    name - The non-null name of the search item. 
    obj - The object bound to name. Can be null. 
    attrs - The attributes that were requested to be returned with this search item. Cannot 
       be null. 
    isRelative - true if name is relative to the target context of the search (which is named by 
       the first parameter of the search() method); false if name is a URL 
       string. 

*javax.naming.directory.SearchResult(String,String,Object,Attributes)*

public SearchResult(
  java.lang.String name,
  java.lang.String className,
  java.lang.Object obj,
  javax.naming.directory.Attributes attrs)

Constructs a search result using the result's name, its class name, its bound 
object, and its attributes. 

    name - The non-null name of the search item. It is relative to the target context of 
       the search (which is named by the first parameter of the search() 
       method) 
    className - The possibly null class name of the object bound to name. If null, the class 
       name of obj is returned by getClassName(). If obj is also null, 
       getClassName() will return null. 
    obj - The object bound to name. Can be null. 
    attrs - The attributes that were requested to be returned with this search item. Cannot 
       be null. 

*javax.naming.directory.SearchResult(String,String,Object,Attributes,boolean)*

public SearchResult(
  java.lang.String name,
  java.lang.String className,
  java.lang.Object obj,
  javax.naming.directory.Attributes attrs,
  boolean isRelative)

Constructs a search result using the result's name, its class name, its bound 
object, its attributes, and whether the name is relative. 

    name - The non-null name of the search item. 
    className - The possibly null class name of the object bound to name. If null, the class 
       name of obj is returned by getClassName(). If obj is also null, 
       getClassName() will return null. 
    obj - The object bound to name. Can be null. 
    attrs - The attributes that were requested to be returned with this search item. Cannot 
       be null. 
    isRelative - true if name is relative to the target context of the search (which is named by 
       the first parameter of the search() method); false if name is a URL 
       string. 

*javax.naming.directory.SearchResult.getAttributes()*

public |javax.naming.directory.Attributes| getAttributes()

Retrieves the attributes in this search result. 


    Returns: The non-null attributes in this search result. Can be empty. 
*javax.naming.directory.SearchResult.setAttributes(Attributes)*

public void setAttributes(javax.naming.directory.Attributes attrs)

Sets the attributes of this search result to attrs. 

    attrs - The non-null attributes to use. Can be empty. 

*javax.naming.directory.SearchResult.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Generates the string representation of this SearchResult. The string 
representation consists of the string representation of the binding and the 
string representation of this search result's attributes, separated by ':'. The 
contents of this string is useful for debugging and is not meant to be 
interpreted programmatically. 


    Returns: The string representation of this SearchResult. Cannot be null.
