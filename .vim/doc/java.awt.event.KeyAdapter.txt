*java.awt.event.KeyAdapter_Description*

An abstract adapter class for receiving keyboard events. The methods in this 
class are empty. This class exists as convenience for creating listener 
objects. 

Extend this class to create a KeyEvent listener and override the methods for 
the events of interest. (If you implement the KeyListener interface, you have 
to define all of the methods in it. This abstract class defines null methods 
for them all, so you can only have to define methods for events you care 
about.) 

Create a listener object using the extended class and then register it with a 
component using the component's addKeyListener method. When a key is pressed, 
released, or typed, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and 
the KeyEvent is passed to it.
