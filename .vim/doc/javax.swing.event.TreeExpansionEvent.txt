*javax.swing.event.TreeExpansionEvent_Description*

An event used to identify a single path in a tree. The source returned by 
getSource will be an instance of JTree. 

For further documentation and examples see the following sections in The Java 
Tutorial: How to Write a Tree Expansion Listener and How to Write a 
Tree-Will-Expand Listener. 

Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future 
Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term 
storage or RMI between applications running the same version of Swing. As of 
1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the 
java.beans package. Please see (|java.beans.XMLEncoder|) .

*javax.swing.event.TreeExpansionEvent(Object,TreePath)*

public TreeExpansionEvent(
  java.lang.Object source,
  javax.swing.tree.TreePath path)

Constructs a TreeExpansionEvent object. 

    source - the Object that originated the event (typically this) 
    path - a TreePath object identifying the newly expanded node 

*javax.swing.event.TreeExpansionEvent.getPath()*

public |javax.swing.tree.TreePath| getPath()

Returns the path to the value that has been expanded/collapsed.
