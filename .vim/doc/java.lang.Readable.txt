*java.lang.Readable_Description*

A Readable is a source of characters. Characters from a Readable are made 
available to callers of the read method via a CharBuffer(|java.nio.CharBuffer|) 
. 


*java.lang.Readable.read(CharBuffer)*

public int read(java.nio.CharBuffer cb)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Attempts to read characters into the specified character buffer. The buffer is 
used as a repository of characters as-is: the only changes made are the results 
of a put operation. No flipping or rewinding of the buffer is performed. 

    cb - the buffer to read characters into 

    Returns: @return The number of char values added to the buffer, or -1 if this source of 
             characters is at its end
