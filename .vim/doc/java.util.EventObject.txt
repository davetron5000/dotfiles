*java.util.EventObject_Description*

The root class from which all event state objects shall be derived. 

All Events are constructed with a reference to the object, the "source", that is logically deemed to be the object upon which the Event in question initially occurred upon. 



*java.lang.Object_java.util.EventObject.source*

The object on which the Event initially occurred. 



*java.util.EventObject(Object)*

public EventObject(java.lang.Object source)

Constructs a prototypical Event. 

    source - The object on which the Event initially occurred. 

*java.util.EventObject.getSource()*

public |java.lang.Object| getSource()

The object on which the Event initially occurred. 



    Returns: The object on which the Event initially occurred. 

*java.util.EventObject.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Returns a String representation of this EventObject. 



    Returns: A a String representation of this EventObject.
