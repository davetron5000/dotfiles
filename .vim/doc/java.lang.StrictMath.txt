*java.lang.StrictMath_Description*

The class StrictMath contains methods for performing basic numeric operations such as the elementary exponential, logarithm, square root, and trigonometric functions. 

To help ensure portability of Java programs, the definitions of some of the numeric functions in this package require that they produce the same results as certain published 
algorithms. These algorithms are available from the well-known network library netlib as the package "Freely Distributable Math Library," fdlibm. These algorithms, which are 
written in the C programming language, are then to be understood as executed with all floating-point operations following the rules of Java floating-point arithmetic. 

The Java math library is defined with respect to fdlibm version 5.3. Where fdlibm provides more than one definition for a function (such as acos), use the "IEEE 754 core function" 
version (residing in a file whose name begins with the letter e). The methods which require fdlibm semantics are sin, cos, tan, asin, acos, atan, exp, log, log10, cbrt, atan2, 
pow, sinh, cosh, tanh, hypot, expm1, and log1p.

*java.lang.StrictMath.random()*

public static double random()

Returns a double value with a positive sign, greater than or equal to 0.0 and less than 1.0. Returned values are chosen pseudorandomly with (approximately) uniform distribution 
from that range. 

When this method is first called, it creates a single new pseudorandom-number generator, exactly as if by the expression 

new java.util.Random This new pseudorandom-number generator is used thereafter for all calls to this method and is used nowhere else. 

This method is properly synchronized to allow correct use by more than one thread. However, if many threads need to generate pseudorandom numbers at a great rate, it may reduce 
contention for each thread to have its own pseudorandom number generator.

    Returns: the value of the argument rounded to the nearest int value. 

*java.lang.StrictMath.signum(double)*

public static double signum(double d)

Returns the signum function of the argument; zero if the argument is zero, 1.0 if the argument is greater than zero, -1.0 if the argument is less than zero. 

Special Cases: 

If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN. If the argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the result is the same as the argument.

public static float signum(float f)

Returns the signum function of the argument; zero if the argument is zero, 1.0f if the argument is greater than zero, -1.0f if the argument is less than zero. 

Special Cases: 

If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN. If the argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the result is the same as the argument. 


    f - the floating-point value whose signum is to be returned 

    Returns: the signum function of the argument 

*java.lang.StrictMath.sin(double)*

public static native double sin(double a)

Returns the trigonometric sine of an angle. Special cases: If the argument is NaN or an infinity, then the result is NaN. If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with 
the same sign as the argument. 


    a - an angle, in radians. 

    Returns: the sine of the argument. 

*java.lang.StrictMath.sinh(double)*

public static native double sinh(double x)

Returns the hyperbolic sine of a double value. The hyperbolic sine of x is defined to be (ex-e-x)/2 where e is Euler's number(|java.lang.Math|) . 

Special cases: 

If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN. 

If the argument is infinite, then the result is an infinity with the same sign as the argument. 

If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument.

    Returns: The hyperbolic sine of x. 

*java.lang.StrictMath.sqrt(double)*

public static native double sqrt(double a)

Returns the correctly rounded positive square root of a double value. Special cases: If the argument is NaN or less than zero, then the result is NaN. If the argument is positive 
infinity, then the result is positive infinity. If the argument is positive zero or negative zero, then the result is the same as the argument. Otherwise, the result is the double 
value closest to the true mathematical square root of the argument value. 


    a - a value. 

    Returns: the positive square root of a. 

*java.lang.StrictMath.tan(double)*

public static native double tan(double a)

Returns the trigonometric tangent of an angle. Special cases: If the argument is NaN or an infinity, then the result is NaN. If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero 
with the same sign as the argument. 


    a - an angle, in radians. 

    Returns: the tangent of the argument. 

*java.lang.StrictMath.tanh(double)*

public static native double tanh(double x)

Returns the hyperbolic tangent of a double value. The hyperbolic tangent of x is defined to be (ex-e-x)/(ex+e-x), in other words, sinh(<i>x</i>)(|java.lang.Math|) / 
cosh(<i>x</i>)(|java.lang.Math|) . Note that the absolute value of the exact tanh is always less than 1. 

Special cases: 

If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN. 

If the argument is zero, then the result is a zero with the same sign as the argument. 

If the argument is positive infinity, then the result is +1.0. 

If the argument is negative infinity, then the result is -1.0. 




    x - The number whose hyperbolic tangent is to be returned. 

    Returns: The hyperbolic tangent of x. 

*java.lang.StrictMath.toDegrees(double)*

public static double toDegrees(double angrad)

Converts an angle measured in radians to an approximately equivalent angle measured in degrees. The conversion from radians to degrees is generally inexact; users should not 
expect cos(toRadians(90.0)) to exactly equal 0.0. 


    angrad - an angle, in radians 

    Returns: the measurement of the angle angrad in degrees. 

*java.lang.StrictMath.toRadians(double)*

public static double toRadians(double angdeg)

Converts an angle measured in degrees to an approximately equivalent angle measured in radians. The conversion from degrees to radians is generally inexact. 


    angdeg - an angle, in degrees 

    Returns: the measurement of the angle angdeg in radians. 

*java.lang.StrictMath.ulp(double)*

public static double ulp(double d)

Returns the size of an ulp of the argument. An ulp of a double value is the positive distance between this floating-point value and the double value next larger in magnitude. Note 
that for non-NaN x, ulp(-x) == ulp(x). 

Special Cases: 

If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN. If the argument is positive or negative infinity, then the result is positive infinity. If the argument is positive or negative 
zero, then the result is Double.MIN_VALUE. If the argument is Double.MAX_VALUE, then the result is equal to 2971. 


    d - the floating-point value whose ulp is to be returned 

    Returns: the size of an ulp of the argument 

*java.lang.StrictMath.ulp(float)*

public static float ulp(float f)

Returns the size of an ulp of the argument. An ulp of a float value is the positive distance between this floating-point value and the float value next larger in magnitude. Note 
that for non-NaN x, ulp(-x) == ulp(x). 

Special Cases: 

If the argument is NaN, then the result is NaN. If the argument is positive or negative infinity, then the result is positive infinity. If the argument is positive or negative 
zero, then the result is Float.MIN_VALUE. If the argument is Float.MAX_VALUE, then the result is equal to 2104. 


    f - the floating-point value whose ulp is to be returned 

    Returns: the size of an ulp of the argument
