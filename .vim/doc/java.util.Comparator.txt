*java.util.Comparator_Description*

A comparison function, which imposes a total ordering on some collection of objects. Comparators can be passed to a sort method (such as Collections.sort) to allow precise control 
over the sort order. Comparators can also be used to control the order of certain data structures (such as TreeSet or TreeMap). 

The ordering imposed by a Comparator c on a set of elements S is said to be consistent with equals if and only if (compare((Object)e1, (Object)e2)==0) has the same boolean value 
as e1.equals((Object)e2) for every e1 and e2 in S. 

Caution should be exercised when using a comparator capable of imposing an ordering inconsistent with equals to order a sorted set (or sorted map). Suppose a sorted set (or sorted 
map) with an explicit Comparator c is used with elements (or keys) drawn from a set S. If the ordering imposed by c on S is inconsistent with equals, the sorted set (or sorted 
map) will behave "strangely." In particular the sorted set (or sorted map) will violate the general contract for set (or map), which is defined in terms of equals. 

For example, if one adds two keys a and b such that (a.equals((Object)b) c.compare((Object)a, (Object)b) != 0) to a sorted set with comparator c, the second add operation will 
return false (and the size of the sorted set will not increase) because a and b are equivalent from the sorted set's perspective. 

Note: It is generally a good idea for comparators to implement java.io.Serializable, as they may be used as ordering methods in serializable data structures (like TreeSet, 
TreeMap). In order for the data structure to serialize successfully, the comparator (if provided) must implement Serializable. 

For the mathematically inclined, the relation that defines the total order that a given comparator c imposes on a given set of objects S is: 

{(x, y) such that c.compare((Object)x, (Object)y) <= 0}. 

The quotient for this total order is: 

{(x, y) such that c.compare((Object)x, (Object)y) == 0}. 

It follows immediately from the contract for compare that the quotient is an equivalence relation on S, and that the natural ordering is a total order on S. When we say that the 
ordering imposed by c on S is consistent with equals, we mean that the quotient for the natural ordering is the equivalence relation defined by the objects' equals(Object) 
method(s): 

{(x, y) such that x.equals((Object)y)}.

*java.util.Comparator.compare(T,T)*

public int compare(
  T o1,
  T o2)

Compares its two arguments for order. Returns a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. 

The implementor must ensure that sgn(compare(x, y)) == -sgn(compare(y, x)) for all x and y. (This implies that compare(x, y) must throw an exception if and only if compare(y, x) 
throws an exception.) 

The implementor must also ensure that the relation is transitive: ((compare(x, y)>0) and and (compare(y, z)>0)) implies compare(x, z)>0. 

Finally, the implementer must ensure that compare(x, y)==0 implies that sgn(compare(x, z))==sgn(compare(y, z)) for all z. 

It is generally the case, but not strictly required that (compare(x, y)==0) == (x.equals(y)). Generally speaking, any comparator that violates this condition should clearly 
indicate this fact. The recommended language is "Note: this comparator imposes orderings that are inconsistent with equals." 


    o1 - the first object to be compared. 
    o2 - the second object to be compared. 

    Returns: a negative integer, zero, or a positive integer as the first argument is less than, equal to, or greater than the second. 

*java.util.Comparator.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Indicates whether some other object is equal to this Comparator. This method must obey the general contract of Object.equals(Object). Additionally, this method can return true 
only if the specified Object is also a comparator and it imposes the same ordering as this comparator. Thus, comp1.equals(comp2) implies that sgn(comp1.compare(o1, 
o2))==sgn(comp2.compare(o1, o2)) for every object reference o1 and o2. 

Note that it is always safe not to override Object.equals(Object). However, overriding this method may, in some cases, improve performance by allowing programs to determine that 
two distinct Comparators impose the same order. 


    obj - the reference object with which to compare. 

    Returns: true only if the specified object is also a comparator and it imposes the same ordering as this comparator.
