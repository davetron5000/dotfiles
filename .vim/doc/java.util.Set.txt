*java.util.Set_Description*

A collection that contains no duplicate elements. More formally, sets contain no pair of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and at most one null element. As implied by 
its name, this interface models the mathematical set abstraction. 

The Set interface places additional stipulations, beyond those inherited from the Collection interface, on the contracts of all constructors and on the contracts of the add, 
equals and hashCode methods. Declarations for other inherited methods are also included here for convenience. (The specifications accompanying these declarations have been 
tailored to the Set interface, but they do not contain any additional stipulations.) 

The additional stipulation on constructors is, not surprisingly, that all constructors must create a set that contains no duplicate elements (as defined above). 

Note: Great care must be exercised if mutable objects are used as set elements. The behavior of a set is not specified if the value of an object is changed in a manner that 
affects equals comparisons while the object is an element in the set. A special case of this prohibition is that it is not permissible for a set to contain itself as an element. 

Some set implementations have restrictions on the elements that they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements, and some have restrictions on the types 
of their elements. Attempting to add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException. Attempting to query the presence of 
an ineligible element may throw an exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. More 
generally, attempting an operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the set may throw an exception or it 
may succeed, at the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this interface. 

This interface is a member of the <a href="/../guide/collections/index.html"> Java Collections Framework. 



*java.util.Set.add(E)*

public boolean add(E o)

Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present (optional operation). More formally, adds the specified element, o, to this set if this set contains no element 
e such that (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e)). If this set already contains the specified element, the call leaves this set unchanged and returns false. In combination with the 
restriction on constructors, this ensures that sets never contain duplicate elements. 

The stipulation above does not imply that sets must accept all elements; sets may refuse to add any particular element, including null, and throwing an exception, as described in 
the specification for Collection.add. Individual set implementations should clearly document any restrictions on the elements that they may contain. 


    o - element to be added to this set. 

    Returns: true if this set did not already contain the specified element. 

*java.util.Set.addAll(Collection<?extendsE>)*

public boolean addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set if they're not already present (optional operation). If the specified collection is also a set, the addAll 
operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the union of the two sets. The behavior of this operation is unspecified if the specified collection is modified while 
the operation is in progress. 


    c - collection whose elements are to be added to this set. 

    Returns: true if this set changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.Set.clear()*

public void clear()

Removes all of the elements from this set (optional operation). This set will be empty after this call returns (unless it throws an exception). 



*java.util.Set.contains(Object)*

public boolean contains(java.lang.Object o)

Returns true if this set contains the specified element. More formally, returns true if and only if this set contains an element e such that (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e)). 


    o - element whose presence in this set is to be tested. 

    Returns: true if this set contains the specified element. 

*java.util.Set.containsAll(Collection<?>)*

public boolean containsAll(java.util.Collection<?> c)

Returns true if this set contains all of the elements of the specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this method returns true if it is a subset of this 
set. 


    c - collection to be checked for containment in this set. 

    Returns: true if this set contains all of the elements of the specified collection. 

*java.util.Set.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object o)

Compares the specified object with this set for equality. Returns true if the specified object is also a set, the two sets have the same size, and every member of the specified 
set is contained in this set (or equivalently, every member of this set is contained in the specified set). This definition ensures that the equals method works properly across 
different implementations of the set interface. 


    o - Object to be compared for equality with this set. 

    Returns: true if the specified Object is equal to this set. 

*java.util.Set.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this set. The hash code of a set is defined to be the sum of the hash codes of the elements in the set, where the hashcode of a null element is 
defined to be zero. This ensures that s1.equals(s2) implies that s1.hashCode()==s2.hashCode() for any two sets s1 and s2, as required by the general contract of the 
Object.hashCode method. 



    Returns: the hash code value for this set. 

*java.util.Set.isEmpty()*

public boolean isEmpty()

Returns true if this set contains no elements. 



    Returns: true if this set contains no elements. 

*java.util.Set.iterator()*

public |java.util.Iterator|<E> iterator()

Returns an iterator over the elements in this set. The elements are returned in no particular order (unless this set is an instance of some class that provides a guarantee). 



    Returns: an iterator over the elements in this set. 

*java.util.Set.remove(Object)*

public boolean remove(java.lang.Object o)

Removes the specified element from this set if it is present (optional operation). More formally, removes an element e such that (o==null ? e==null : o.equals(e)), if the set 
contains such an element. Returns true if the set contained the specified element (or equivalently, if the set changed as a result of the call). (The set will not contain the 
specified element once the call returns.) 


    o - object to be removed from this set, if present. 

    Returns: true if the set contained the specified element. 

*java.util.Set.removeAll(Collection<?>)*

public boolean removeAll(java.util.Collection<?> c)

Removes from this set all of its elements that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation). If the specified collection is also a set, this operation 
effectively modifies this set so that its value is the asymmetric set difference of the two sets. 


    c - collection that defines which elements will be removed from this set. 

    Returns: true if this set changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.Set.retainAll(Collection<?>)*

public boolean retainAll(java.util.Collection<?> c)

Retains only the elements in this set that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes from this set all of its elements that are not 
contained in the specified collection. If the specified collection is also a set, this operation effectively modifies this set so that its value is the intersection of the two 
sets. 


    c - collection that defines which elements this set will retain. 

    Returns: true if this collection changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.Set.size()*

public int size()

Returns the number of elements in this set (its cardinality). If this set contains more than Integer.MAX_VALUE elements, returns Integer.MAX_VALUE. 



    Returns: the number of elements in this set (its cardinality). 

*java.util.Set.toArray()*

public |java.lang.Object|[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set. Obeys the general contract of the Collection.toArray method. 



    Returns: an array containing all of the elements in this set. 

*java.util.Set.toArray(T[])*

public |T|[] toArray(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this set; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. Obeys the general contract of the 
Collection.toArray(Object[]) method. 


    a - the array into which the elements of this set are to be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same runtime type is allocated for this purpose. 

    Returns: an array containing the elements of this set.
