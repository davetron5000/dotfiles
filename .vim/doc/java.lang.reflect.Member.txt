*java.lang.reflect.Member_Description*

Member is an interface that reflects identifying information about a single member (a field or a method) or a constructor. 



*int_java.lang.reflect.Member.DECLARED*

Identifies the set of declared members of a class or interface. Inherited members are not included. 


*int_java.lang.reflect.Member.PUBLIC*

Identifies the set of all public members of a class or interface, including inherited members. 



*java.lang.reflect.Member.getDeclaringClass()*

public |java.lang.Class| getDeclaringClass()

Returns the Class object representing the class or interface that declares the member or constructor represented by this Member. 



    Returns: an object representing the declaring class of the underlying member 

*java.lang.reflect.Member.getModifiers()*

public int getModifiers()

Returns the Java language modifiers for the member or constructor represented by this Member, as an integer. The Modifier class should be used to decode the modifiers in the 
integer. 



    Returns: the Java language modifiers for the underlying member 

*java.lang.reflect.Member.getName()*

public |java.lang.String| getName()

Returns the simple name of the underlying member or constructor represented by this Member. 



    Returns: the simple name of the underlying member 

*java.lang.reflect.Member.isSynthetic()*

public boolean isSynthetic()

Returns true if this member was introduced by the compiler; returns false otherwise. 



    Returns: true if and only if this member was introduced by the compiler.
