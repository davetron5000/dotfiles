*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream_Description*

This class implements an output stream filter for writing files in the ZIP file format. Includes support for both compressed and uncompressed entries. 



*int_java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.DEFLATED*

Compression method for compressed (DEFLATED) entries. 


*int_java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.STORED*

Compression method for uncompressed (STORED) entries. 



*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream(OutputStream)*

public ZipOutputStream(java.io.OutputStream out)

Creates a new ZIP output stream. 

    out - the actual output stream 

*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.close()*

public void close()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Closes the ZIP output stream as well as the stream being filtered. 



*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.closeEntry()*

public void closeEntry()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Closes the current ZIP entry and positions the stream for writing the next entry. 



*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.finish()*

public void finish()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Finishes writing the contents of the ZIP output stream without closing the underlying stream. Use this method when applying multiple filters in succession to the same output 
stream. 



*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.putNextEntry(ZipEntry)*

public void putNextEntry(java.util.zip.ZipEntry e)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Begins writing a new ZIP file entry and positions the stream to the start of the entry data. Closes the current entry if still active. The default compression method will be used 
if no compression method was specified for the entry, and the current time will be used if the entry has no set modification time. 


    e - the ZIP entry to be written 

*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.setComment(String)*

public void setComment(java.lang.String comment)

Sets the ZIP file comment. 


    comment - the comment string 

*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.setLevel(int)*

public void setLevel(int level)

Sets the compression level for subsequent entries which are DEFLATED. The default setting is DEFAULT_COMPRESSION. 


    level - the compression level (0-9) 

*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.setMethod(int)*

public void setMethod(int method)

Sets the default compression method for subsequent entries. This default will be used whenever the compression method is not specified for an individual ZIP file entry, and is 
initially set to DEFLATED. 


    method - the default compression method 

*java.util.zip.ZipOutputStream.write(byte[],int,int)*

public synchronized void write(
  byte[] b,
  int off,
  int len)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes an array of bytes to the current ZIP entry data. This method will block until all the bytes are written. 


    b - the data to be written 
    off - the start offset in the data 
    len - the number of bytes that are written
