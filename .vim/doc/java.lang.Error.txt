*java.lang.Error_Description*

An Error is a subclass of Throwable that indicates serious problems that a 
reasonable application should not try to catch. Most such errors are abnormal 
conditions. The ThreadDeath error, though a "normal" condition, is also a 
subclass of Error because most applications should not try to catch it. 

A method is not required to declare in its throws clause any subclasses of 
Error that might be thrown during the execution of the method but not caught, 
since these errors are abnormal conditions that should never occur. 


*java.lang.Error()*

public Error()

Constructs a new error with null as its detail message. The cause is not 
initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to 
(|java.lang.Error|) . 


*java.lang.Error(String)*

public Error(java.lang.String message)

Constructs a new error with the specified detail message. The cause is not 
initialized, and may subsequently be initialized by a call to 
(|java.lang.Error|) . 

    message - the detail message. The detail message is saved for later retrieval by the 
       {@link #getMessage()} method. 

*java.lang.Error(String,Throwable)*

public Error(
  java.lang.String message,
  java.lang.Throwable cause)

Constructs a new error with the specified detail message and cause. Note that 
the detail message associated with cause is not automatically incorporated in 
this error's detail message. 

    message - the detail message (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link 
       #getMessage()} method). 
    cause - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link #getCause()} 
       method). (A null value is permitted, and indicates that the cause is 
       nonexistent or unknown.) 

*java.lang.Error(Throwable)*

public Error(java.lang.Throwable cause)

Constructs a new error with the specified cause and a detail message of 
(cause==null ? null : cause.toString()) (which typically contains the class and 
detail message of cause). This constructor is useful for errors that are little 
more than wrappers for other throwables. 

    cause - the cause (which is saved for later retrieval by the {@link #getCause()} 
       method). (A null value is permitted, and indicates that the cause is 
       nonexistent or unknown.)
