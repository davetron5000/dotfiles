*java.net.URLEncoder_Description*

Utility class for HTML form encoding. This class contains static methods for 
converting a String to the application/x-www-form-urlencoded MIME format. For 
more information about HTML form encoding, consult the HTML specification. 

When encoding a String, the following rules apply: 



The alphanumeric characters a through z, A through Z and 0 through 9 remain the 
same. The special characters ., -, *, and _ remain the same. The space 
character is converted into a plus sign +. All other characters are unsafe and 
are first converted into one or more bytes using some encoding scheme. Then 
each byte is represented by the 3-character string %xy, where xy is the 
two-digit hexadecimal representation of the byte. The recommended encoding 
scheme to use is UTF-8. However, for compatibility reasons, if an encoding is 
not specified, then the default encoding of the platform is used. 

For example using UTF-8 as the encoding scheme the string The string @foo-bar 
would get converted to The+string+%C3%BC%40foo-bar because in UTF-8 the 
character is encoded as two bytes C3 (hex) and BC (hex), and the character @ is 
encoded as one byte 40 (hex). 


*java.net.URLEncoder.encode(String)*

public static |java.lang.String| encode(java.lang.String s)

Translates a string into x-www-form-urlencoded format. This method uses the 
platform's default encoding as the encoding scheme to obtain the bytes for 
unsafe characters. 

    s - String to be translated. 

    Returns: the translated String. 
*java.net.URLEncoder.encode(String,String)*

public static |java.lang.String| encode(
  java.lang.String s,
  java.lang.String enc)
  throws |java.io.UnsupportedEncodingException|
         
Translates a string into application/x-www-form-urlencoded format using a 
specific encoding scheme. This method uses the supplied encoding scheme to 
obtain the bytes for unsafe characters. 

Note: The World Wide Web Consortium Recommendation states that UTF-8 should be 
used. Not doing so may introduce incompatibilites. 

    s - String to be translated. 
    enc - The name of a supported character encoding. 

    Returns: the translated String.
