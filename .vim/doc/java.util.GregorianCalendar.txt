*java.util.GregorianCalendar_Description*

GregorianCalendar is a concrete subclass of Calendar and provides the standard calendar system used by most of the world. 

GregorianCalendar is a hybrid calendar that supports both the Julian and Gregorian calendar systems with the support of a single discontinuity, which corresponds by default to the 
Gregorian date when the Gregorian calendar was instituted (October 15, 1582 in some countries, later in others). The cutover date may be changed by the caller by calling 
setGregorianChange()(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) . 

Historically, in those countries which adopted the Gregorian calendar first, October 4, 1582 (Julian) was thus followed by October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). This calendar models this 
correctly. Before the Gregorian cutover, GregorianCalendar implements the Julian calendar. The only difference between the Gregorian and the Julian calendar is the leap year rule. 
The Julian calendar specifies leap years every four years, whereas the Gregorian calendar omits century years which are not divisible by 400. 

GregorianCalendar implements proleptic Gregorian and Julian calendars. That is, dates are computed by extrapolating the current rules indefinitely far backward and forward in 
time. As a result, GregorianCalendar may be used for all years to generate meaningful and consistent results. However, dates obtained using GregorianCalendar are historically 
accurate only from March 1, 4 AD onward, when modern Julian calendar rules were adopted. Before this date, leap year rules were applied irregularly, and before 45 BC the Julian 
calendar did not even exist. 

Prior to the institution of the Gregorian calendar, New Year's Day was March 25. To avoid confusion, this calendar always uses January 1. A manual adjustment may be made if 
desired for dates that are prior to the Gregorian changeover and which fall between January 1 and March 24. 

Values calculated for the WEEK_OF_YEAR field range from 1 to 53. Week 1 for a year is the earliest seven day period starting on getFirstDayOfWeek() that contains at least 
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() days from that year. It thus depends on the values of getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(), getFirstDayOfWeek(), and the day of the week of January 1. Weeks 
between week 1 of one year and week 1 of the following year are numbered sequentially from 2 to 52 or 53 (as needed). 

For example, January 1, 1998 was a Thursday. If getFirstDayOfWeek() is MONDAY and getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is 4 (these are the values reflecting ISO 8601 and many national 
standards), then week 1 of 1998 starts on December 29, 1997, and ends on January 4, 1998. If, however, getFirstDayOfWeek() is SUNDAY, then week 1 of 1998 starts on January 4, 
1998, and ends on January 10, 1998; the first three days of 1998 then are part of week 53 of 1997. 

Values calculated for the WEEK_OF_MONTH field range from 0 to 6. Week 1 of a month (the days with WEEK_OF_MONTH = 1) is the earliest set of at least getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() 
contiguous days in that month, ending on the day before getFirstDayOfWeek(). Unlike week 1 of a year, week 1 of a month may be shorter than 7 days, need not start on 
getFirstDayOfWeek(), and will not include days of the previous month. Days of a month before week 1 have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 0. 

For example, if getFirstDayOfWeek() is SUNDAY and getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is 4, then the first week of January 1998 is Sunday, January 4 through Saturday, January 10. These 
days have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 1. Thursday, January 1 through Saturday, January 3 have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 0. If getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek() is changed to 3, then January 1 through 
January 3 have a WEEK_OF_MONTH of 1. 

The clear methods set calendar field(s) undefined. GregorianCalendar uses the following default value for each calendar field if its value is undefined.

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.add(int,int)*

public void add(
  int field,
  int amount)

Adds the specified (signed) amount of time to the given calendar field, based on the calendar's rules. 

Add rule 1. The value of field after the call minus the value of field before the call is amount, modulo any overflow that has occurred in field. Overflow occurs when a field 
value exceeds its range and, as a result, the next larger field is incremented or decremented and the field value is adjusted back into its range. 

Add rule 2. If a smaller field is expected to be invariant, but it is impossible for it to be equal to its prior value because of changes in its minimum or maximum after field is 
changed, then its value is adjusted to be as close as possible to its expected value. A smaller field represents a smaller unit of time. HOUR is a smaller field than DAY_OF_MONTH. 
No adjustment is made to smaller fields that are not expected to be invariant. The calendar system determines what fields are expected to be invariant. 


    field - the calendar field. 
    amount - the amount of date or time to be added to the field. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.clone()*

public |java.lang.Object| clone()





*java.util.GregorianCalendar.computeFields()*

protected void computeFields()

Converts the time value (millisecond offset from the Epoch) to calendar field values. The time is not recomputed first; to recompute the time, then the fields, call the complete 
method. 



*java.util.GregorianCalendar.computeTime()*

protected void computeTime()

Converts calendar field values to the time value (millisecond offset from the Epoch). 



*java.util.GregorianCalendar.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object obj)

Compares this GregorianCalendar to the specified Object. The result is true if and only if the argument is a GregorianCalendar object that represents the same time value 
(millisecond offset from the Epoch) under the same Calendar parameters and Gregorian change date as this object. 


    obj - the object to compare with. 

    Returns: true if this object is equal to obj; false otherwise. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.getActualMaximum(int)*

public int getActualMaximum(int field)

Returns the maximum value that this calendar field could have, taking into consideration the given time value and the current values of the getFirstDayOfWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) 
, getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , getGregorianChange(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) and getTimeZone(|java.util.Calendar|) methods. For example, if the date of 
this instance is February 1, 2004, the actual maximum value of the DAY_OF_MONTH field is 29 because 2004 is a leap year, and if the date of this instance is February 1, 2005, it's 
28. 


    field - the calendar field 

    Returns: the maximum of the given field for the time value of this GregorianCalendar 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.getActualMinimum(int)*

public int getActualMinimum(int field)

Returns the minimum value that this calendar field could have, taking into consideration the given time value and the current values of the getFirstDayOfWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) 
, getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , getGregorianChange(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) and getTimeZone(|java.util.Calendar|) methods. 

For example, if the Gregorian change date is January 10, 1970 and the date of this GregorianCalendar is January 20, 1970, the actual minimum value of the DAY_OF_MONTH field is 10 
because the previous date of January 10, 1970 is December 27, 1996 (in the Julian calendar). Therefore, December 28, 1969 to January 9, 1970 don't exist. 


    field - the calendar field 

    Returns: the minimum of the given field for the time value of this GregorianCalendar 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.getGreatestMinimum(int)*

public int getGreatestMinimum(int field)

Returns the highest minimum value for the given calendar field of this GregorianCalendar instance. The highest minimum value is defined as the largest value returned by 
(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) for any possible time value, taking into consideration the current values of the getFirstDayOfWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , 
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , getGregorianChange(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) and getTimeZone(|java.util.Calendar|) methods. 


    field - the calendar field. 

    Returns: the highest minimum value for the given calendar field. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.getGregorianChange()*

public final |java.util.Date| getGregorianChange()

Gets the Gregorian Calendar change date. This is the point when the switch from Julian dates to Gregorian dates occurred. Default is October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). Previous to 
this, dates will be in the Julian calendar. 



    Returns: the Gregorian cutover date for this GregorianCalendar object. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.getLeastMaximum(int)*

public int getLeastMaximum(int field)

Returns the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field of this GregorianCalendar instance. The lowest maximum value is defined as the smallest value returned by 
(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) for any possible time value, taking into consideration the current values of the getFirstDayOfWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , 
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , getGregorianChange(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) and getTimeZone(|java.util.Calendar|) methods. 


    field - the calendar field 

    Returns: the lowest maximum value for the given calendar field. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.getMaximum(int)*

public int getMaximum(int field)

Returns the maximum value for the given calendar field of this GregorianCalendar instance. The maximum value is defined as the largest value returned by the 
get(|java.util.Calendar|) method for any possible time value, taking into consideration the current values of the getFirstDayOfWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , 
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , getGregorianChange(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) and getTimeZone(|java.util.Calendar|) methods. 


    field - the calendar field. 

    Returns: the maximum value for the given calendar field. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.getMinimum(int)*

public int getMinimum(int field)

Returns the minimum value for the given calendar field of this GregorianCalendar instance. The minimum value is defined as the smallest value returned by the 
get(|java.util.Calendar|) method for any possible time value, taking into consideration the current values of the getFirstDayOfWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , 
getMinimalDaysInFirstWeek(|java.util.Calendar|) , getGregorianChange(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) and getTimeZone(|java.util.Calendar|) methods. 


    field - the calendar field. 

    Returns: the minimum value for the given calendar field. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.getTimeZone()*

public |java.util.TimeZone| getTimeZone()





*java.util.GregorianCalendar.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Generates the hash code for this GregorianCalendar object. 



*java.util.GregorianCalendar.isLeapYear(int)*

public boolean isLeapYear(int year)

Determines if the given year is a leap year. Returns true if the given year is a leap year. To specify BC year numbers, 1 - year number must be given. For example, year BC 4 is 
specified as -3. 


    year - the given year. 

    Returns: true if the given year is a leap year; false otherwise. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.roll(int,boolean)*

public void roll(
  int field,
  boolean up)

Adds or subtracts (up/down) a single unit of time on the given time field without changing larger fields. 

Example: Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to December 31, 1999. Calling roll(Calendar.MONTH, true)(|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) sets the calendar to January 31, 1999. 
The YEAR field is unchanged because it is a larger field than MONTH. 


    up - indicates if the value of the specified calendar field is to be rolled up or rolled down. Use true if rolling up, false otherwise. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.roll(int,int)*

public void roll(
  int field,
  int amount)

Adds a signed amount to the specified calendar field without changing larger fields. A negative roll amount means to subtract from field without changing larger fields. If the 
specified amount is 0, this method performs nothing. 

This method calls (|java.util.GregorianCalendar|) before adding the amount so that all the calendar fields are normalized. If there is any calendar field having an out-of-range 
value in non-lenient mode, then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. 

Example: Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to August 31, 1999. Calling roll(Calendar.MONTH, 8) sets the calendar to April 30, 1999. Using a GregorianCalendar, the 
DAY_OF_MONTH field cannot be 31 in the month April. DAY_OF_MONTH is set to the closest possible value, 30. The YEAR field maintains the value of 1999 because it is a larger field 
than MONTH. 

Example: Consider a GregorianCalendar originally set to Sunday June 6, 1999. Calling roll(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1) sets the calendar to Tuesday June 1, 1999, whereas calling 
add(Calendar.WEEK_OF_MONTH, -1) sets the calendar to Sunday May 30, 1999. This is because the roll rule imposes an additional constraint: The MONTH must not change when the 
WEEK_OF_MONTH is rolled. Taken together with add rule 1, the resultant date must be between Tuesday June 1 and Saturday June 5. According to add rule 2, the DAY_OF_WEEK, an 
invariant when changing the WEEK_OF_MONTH, is set to Tuesday, the closest possible value to Sunday (where Sunday is the first day of the week). 


    field - the calendar field. 
    amount - the signed amount to add to field. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.setGregorianChange(Date)*

public void setGregorianChange(java.util.Date date)

Sets the GregorianCalendar change date. This is the point when the switch from Julian dates to Gregorian dates occurred. Default is October 15, 1582 (Gregorian). Previous to this, 
dates will be in the Julian calendar. 

To obtain a pure Julian calendar, set the change date to Date(Long.MAX_VALUE). To obtain a pure Gregorian calendar, set the change date to Date(Long.MIN_VALUE). 


    date - the given Gregorian cutover date. 

*java.util.GregorianCalendar.setTimeZone(TimeZone)*

public void setTimeZone(java.util.TimeZone zone)
