*java.io.DataOutput_Description*

The DataOutput interface provides for converting data from any of the Java primitive types to a series of bytes and writing these bytes to a binary stream. There is also a 
facility for converting a String into modified UTF-8 format and writing the resulting series of bytes. 

For all the methods in this interface that write bytes, it is generally true that if a byte cannot be written for any reason, an IOException is thrown. 



*java.io.DataOutput.write(byte[])*

public void write(byte[] b)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes to the output stream all the bytes in array b. If b is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. If b.length is zero, then no bytes are written. Otherwise, the byte b[0] is 
written first, then b[1], and so on; the last byte written is b[b.length-1]. 


    b - the data. 

*java.io.DataOutput.write(byte[],int,int)*

public void write(
  byte[] b,
  int off,
  int len)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes len bytes from array b, in order, to the output stream. If b is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. If off is negative, or len is negative, or off+len is greater than 
the length of the array b, then an IndexOutOfBoundsException is thrown. If len is zero, then no bytes are written. Otherwise, the byte b[off] is written first, then b[off+1], and 
so on; the last byte written is b[off+len-1]. 


    b - the data. 
    off - the start offset in the data. 
    len - the number of bytes to write. 

*java.io.DataOutput.write(int)*

public void write(int b)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes to the output stream the eight low-order bits of the argument b. The 24 high-order bits of b are ignored. 


    b - the byte to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeBoolean(boolean)*

public void writeBoolean(boolean v)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a boolean value to this output stream. If the argument v is true, the value (byte)1 is written; if v is false, the value (byte)0 is written. The byte written by this method 
may be read by the readBoolean method of interface DataInput, which will then return a boolean equal to v. 


    v - the boolean to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeByte(int)*

public void writeByte(int v)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes to the output stream the eight low- order bits of the argument v. The 24 high-order bits of v are ignored. (This means that writeByte does exactly the same thing as write 
for an integer argument.) The byte written by this method may be read by the readByte method of interface DataInput, which will then return a byte equal to (byte)v. 


    v - the byte value to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeBytes(String)*

public void writeBytes(java.lang.String s)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a string to the output stream. For every character in the string s, taken in order, one byte is written to the output stream. If s is null, a NullPointerException is 
thrown. If s.length is zero, then no bytes are written. Otherwise, the character s[0] is written first, then s[1], and so on; the last character written is s[s.length-1]. For each 
character, one byte is written, the low-order byte, in exactly the manner of the writeByte method . The high-order eight bits of each character in the string are ignored. 


    s - the string of bytes to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeChar(int)*

public void writeChar(int v)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a char value, which is comprised of two bytes, to the output stream. The byte values to be written, in the order shown, are: 

(byte)(0xff and (v >> 8)) (byte)(0xff and v) 

The bytes written by this method may be read by the readChar method of interface DataInput , which will then return a char equal to (char)v. 


    v - the char value to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeChars(String)*

public void writeChars(java.lang.String s)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes every character in the string s, to the output stream, in order, two bytes per character. If s is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. If s.length is zero, then no 
characters are written. Otherwise, the character s[0] is written first, then s[1], and so on; the last character written is s[s.length-1]. For each character, two bytes are 
actually written, high-order byte first, in exactly the manner of the writeChar method. 


    s - the string value to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeDouble(double)*

public void writeDouble(double v)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a double value, which is comprised of eight bytes, to the output stream. It does this as if it first converts this double value to a long in exactly the manner of the 
Double.doubleToLongBits method and then writes the long value in exactly the manner of the writeLong method. The bytes written by this method may be read by the readDouble method 
of interface DataInput, which will then return a double equal to v. 


    v - the double value to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeFloat(float)*

public void writeFloat(float v)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a float value, which is comprised of four bytes, to the output stream. It does this as if it first converts this float value to an int in exactly the manner of the 
Float.floatToIntBits method and then writes the int value in exactly the manner of the writeInt method. The bytes written by this method may be read by the readFloat method of 
interface DataInput, which will then return a float equal to v. 


    v - the float value to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeInt(int)*

public void writeInt(int v)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes an int value, which is comprised of four bytes, to the output stream. The byte values to be written, in the order shown, are: 

(byte)(0xff and (v >> 24)) (byte)(0xff and (v >> 16)) (byte)(0xff and (v >> 8)) (byte)(0xff and v) 

The bytes written by this method may be read by the readInt method of interface DataInput , which will then return an int equal to v. 


    v - the int value to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeLong(long)*

public void writeLong(long v)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a long value, which is comprised of eight bytes, to the output stream. The byte values to be written, in the order shown, are: 

(byte)(0xff and (v >> 56)) (byte)(0xff and (v >> 48)) (byte)(0xff and (v >> 40)) (byte)(0xff and (v >> 32)) (byte)(0xff and (v >> 24)) (byte)(0xff and (v >> 16)) (byte)(0xff and 
(v >> 8)) (byte)(0xff and v) 

The bytes written by this method may be read by the readLong method of interface DataInput , which will then return a long equal to v. 


    v - the long value to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeShort(int)*

public void writeShort(int v)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes two bytes to the output stream to represent the value of the argument. The byte values to be written, in the order shown, are: 

(byte)(0xff and (v >> 8)) (byte)(0xff and v) 

The bytes written by this method may be read by the readShort method of interface DataInput , which will then return a short equal to (short)v. 


    v - the short value to be written. 

*java.io.DataOutput.writeUTF(String)*

public void writeUTF(java.lang.String str)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes two bytes of length information to the output stream, followed by the modified UTF-8 representation of every character in the string s. If s is null, a NullPointerException 
is thrown. Each character in the string s is converted to a group of one, two, or three bytes, depending on the value of the character. If a character c is in the range u0001 
through u007f, it is represented by one byte: 

(byte)c 

If a character c is u0000 or is in the range u0080 through u07ff, then it is represented by two bytes, to be written in the order shown: 

(byte)(0xc0 | (0x1f and (c >> 6))) (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f and c)) 

If a character c is in the range u0800 through uffff, then it is represented by three bytes, to be written in the order shown: 

(byte)(0xe0 | (0x0f and (c >> 12))) (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f and (c >> 6))) (byte)(0x80 | (0x3f and c)) 

First, the total number of bytes needed to represent all the characters of s is calculated. If this number is larger than 65535, then a UTFDataFormatException is thrown. 
Otherwise, this length is written to the output stream in exactly the manner of the writeShort method; after this, the one-, two-, or three-byte representation of each character 
in the string s is written. The bytes written by this method may be read by the readUTF method of interface DataInput , which will then return a String equal to s. 


    str - the string value to be written.
