*java.util.List_Description*

An ordered collection (also known as a sequence). The user of this interface has precise control over where in the list each element is inserted. The user can access elements by 
their integer index (position in the list), and search for elements in the list. 

Unlike sets, lists typically allow duplicate elements. More formally, lists typically allow pairs of elements e1 and e2 such that e1.equals(e2), and they typically allow multiple 
null elements if they allow null elements at all. It is not inconceivable that someone might wish to implement a list that prohibits duplicates, by throwing runtime exceptions 
when the user attempts to insert them, but we expect this usage to be rare. 

The List interface places additional stipulations, beyond those specified in the Collection interface, on the contracts of the iterator, add, remove, equals, and hashCode methods. 
Declarations for other inherited methods are also included here for convenience. 

The List interface provides four methods for positional (indexed) access to list elements. Lists (like Java arrays) are zero based. Note that these operations may execute in time 
proportional to the index value for some implementations (the LinkedList class, for example). Thus, iterating over the elements in a list is typically preferable to indexing 
through it if the caller does not know the implementation. 

The List interface provides a special iterator, called a ListIterator, that allows element insertion and replacement, and bidirectional access in addition to the normal operations 
that the Iterator interface provides. A method is provided to obtain a list iterator that starts at a specified position in the list. 

The List interface provides two methods to search for a specified object. From a performance standpoint, these methods should be used with caution. In many implementations they 
will perform costly linear searches. 

The List interface provides two methods to efficiently insert and remove multiple elements at an arbitrary point in the list. 

Note: While it is permissible for lists to contain themselves as elements, extreme caution is advised: the equals and hashCode methods are no longer well defined on a such a list. 

Some list implementations have restrictions on the elements that they may contain. For example, some implementations prohibit null elements, and some have restrictions on the 
types of their elements. Attempting to add an ineligible element throws an unchecked exception, typically NullPointerException or ClassCastException. Attempting to query the 
presence of an ineligible element may throw an exception, or it may simply return false; some implementations will exhibit the former behavior and some will exhibit the latter. 
More generally, attempting an operation on an ineligible element whose completion would not result in the insertion of an ineligible element into the list may throw an exception 
or it may succeed, at the option of the implementation. Such exceptions are marked as "optional" in the specification for this interface. 

This interface is a member of the <a href="/../guide/collections/index.html"> Java Collections Framework. 



*java.util.List.add(E)*

public boolean add(E o)

Appends the specified element to the end of this list (optional operation). 

Lists that support this operation may place limitations on what elements may be added to this list. In particular, some lists will refuse to add null elements, and others will 
impose restrictions on the type of elements that may be added. List classes should clearly specify in their documentation any restrictions on what elements may be added. 


    o - element to be appended to this list. 

    Returns: true (as per the general contract of the Collection.add method). 

*java.util.List.add(int,E)*

public void add(
  int index,
  E element)

Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list (optional operation). Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to 
the right (adds one to their indices). 


    index - index at which the specified element is to be inserted. 
    element - element to be inserted. 

*java.util.List.addAll(Collection<?extendsE>)*

public boolean addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list, in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator (optional operation). 
The behavior of this operation is unspecified if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. (Note that this will occur if the specified collection is 
this list, and it's nonempty.) 


    c - collection whose elements are to be added to this list. 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.List.addAll(int,Collection<?extendsE>)*

public boolean addAll(
  int index,
  java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list at the specified position (optional operation). Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and 
any subsequent elements to the right (increases their indices). The new elements will appear in this list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's 
iterator. The behavior of this operation is unspecified if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. (Note that this will occur if the specified 
collection is this list, and it's nonempty.) 


    index - index at which to insert first element from the specified collection. 
    c - elements to be inserted into this list. 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.List.clear()*

public void clear()

Removes all of the elements from this list (optional operation). This list will be empty after this call returns (unless it throws an exception). 



*java.util.List.contains(Object)*

public boolean contains(java.lang.Object o)

Returns true if this list contains the specified element. More formally, returns true if and only if this list contains at least one element e such that 
(o==null?e==null:o.equals(e)). 


    o - element whose presence in this list is to be tested. 

    Returns: true if this list contains the specified element. 

*java.util.List.containsAll(Collection<?>)*

public boolean containsAll(java.util.Collection<?> c)

Returns true if this list contains all of the elements of the specified collection. 


    c - collection to be checked for containment in this list. 

    Returns: true if this list contains all of the elements of the specified collection. 

*java.util.List.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object o)

Compares the specified object with this list for equality. Returns true if and only if the specified object is also a list, both lists have the same size, and all corresponding 
pairs of elements in the two lists are equal. (Two elements e1 and e2 are equal if (e1==null ? e2==null : e1.equals(e2)).) In other words, two lists are defined to be equal if 
they contain the same elements in the same order. This definition ensures that the equals method works properly across different implementations of the List interface. 


    o - the object to be compared for equality with this list. 

    Returns: true if the specified object is equal to this list. 

*java.util.List.get(int)*

public |E| get(int index)

Returns the element at the specified position in this list. 


    index - index of element to return. 

    Returns: the element at the specified position in this list. 

*java.util.List.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns the hash code value for this list. The hash code of a list is defined to be the result of the following calculation: 

hashCode = 1; Iterator i = list.iterator(); while (i.hasNext()) { Object obj = i.next(); hashCode = 31*hashCode + (obj==null ? 0 : obj.hashCode()); } 

This ensures that list1.equals(list2) implies that list1.hashCode()==list2.hashCode() for any two lists, list1 and list2, as required by the general contract of Object.hashCode. 



    Returns: the hash code value for this list. 

*java.util.List.indexOf(Object)*

public int indexOf(java.lang.Object o)

Returns the index in this list of the first occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if this list does not contain this element. More formally, returns the lowest index i such 
that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i))), or -1 if there is no such index. 


    o - element to search for. 

    Returns: the index in this list of the first occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if this list does not contain this element. 

*java.util.List.isEmpty()*

public boolean isEmpty()

Returns true if this list contains no elements. 



    Returns: true if this list contains no elements. 

*java.util.List.iterator()*

public |java.util.Iterator|<E> iterator()

Returns an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence. 



    Returns: an iterator over the elements in this list in proper sequence. 

*java.util.List.lastIndexOf(Object)*

public int lastIndexOf(java.lang.Object o)

Returns the index in this list of the last occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if this list does not contain this element. More formally, returns the highest index i such 
that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i))), or -1 if there is no such index. 


    o - element to search for. 

    Returns: the index in this list of the last occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if this list does not contain this element. 

*java.util.List.listIterator()*

public |java.util.ListIterator|<E> listIterator()

Returns a list iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence). 



    Returns: a list iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence). 

*java.util.List.listIterator(int)*

public |java.util.ListIterator|<E> listIterator(int index)

Returns a list iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in this list. The specified index indicates the first element that 
would be returned by an initial call to the next method. An initial call to the previous method would return the element with the specified index minus one. 


    index - index of first element to be returned from the list iterator (by a call to the next method). 

    Returns: a list iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in this list. 

*java.util.List.remove(int)*

public |E| remove(int index)

Removes the element at the specified position in this list (optional operation). Shifts any subsequent elements to the left (subtracts one from their indices). Returns the element 
that was removed from the list. 


    index - the index of the element to removed. 

    Returns: the element previously at the specified position. 

*java.util.List.remove(Object)*

public boolean remove(java.lang.Object o)

Removes the first occurrence in this list of the specified element (optional operation). If this list does not contain the element, it is unchanged. More formally, removes the 
element with the lowest index i such that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i))) (if such an element exists). 


    o - element to be removed from this list, if present. 

    Returns: true if this list contained the specified element. 

*java.util.List.removeAll(Collection<?>)*

public boolean removeAll(java.util.Collection<?> c)

Removes from this list all the elements that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation). 


    c - collection that defines which elements will be removed from this list. 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.List.retainAll(Collection<?>)*

public boolean retainAll(java.util.Collection<?> c)

Retains only the elements in this list that are contained in the specified collection (optional operation). In other words, removes from this list all the elements that are not 
contained in the specified collection. 


    c - collection that defines which elements this set will retain. 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.List.set(int,E)*

public |E| set(
  int index,
  E element)

Replaces the element at the specified position in this list with the specified element (optional operation). 


    index - index of element to replace. 
    element - element to be stored at the specified position. 

    Returns: the element previously at the specified position. 

*java.util.List.size()*

public int size()

Returns the number of elements in this list. If this list contains more than Integer.MAX_VALUE elements, returns Integer.MAX_VALUE. 



    Returns: the number of elements in this list. 

*java.util.List.subList(int,int)*

public |java.util.List|<E> subList(
  int fromIndex,
  int toIndex)

Returns a view of the portion of this list between the specified fromIndex, inclusive, and toIndex, exclusive. (If fromIndex and toIndex are equal, the returned list is empty.) 
The returned list is backed by this list, so non-structural changes in the returned list are reflected in this list, and vice-versa. The returned list supports all of the optional 
list operations supported by this list. 

This method eliminates the need for explicit range operations (of the sort that commonly exist for arrays). Any operation that expects a list can be used as a range operation by 
passing a subList view instead of a whole list. For example, the following idiom removes a range of elements from a list: 

list.subList(from, to).clear(); 

Similar idioms may be constructed for indexOf and lastIndexOf, and all of the algorithms in the Collections class can be applied to a subList. 

The semantics of the list returned by this method become undefined if the backing list (i.e., this list) is structurally modified in any way other than via the returned list. 
(Structural modifications are those that change the size of this list, or otherwise perturb it in such a fashion that iterations in progress may yield incorrect results.) 


    fromIndex - low endpoint (inclusive) of the subList. 
    toIndex - high endpoint (exclusive) of the subList. 

    Returns: a view of the specified range within this list. 

*java.util.List.toArray()*

public |java.lang.Object|[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence. Obeys the general contract of the Collection.toArray method. 



    Returns: an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence. 

*java.util.List.toArray(T[])*

public |T|[] toArray(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in proper sequence; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. Obeys the general contract 
of the Collection.toArray(Object[]) method. 


    a - the array into which the elements of this list are to be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same runtime type is allocated for this purpose. 

    Returns: an array containing the elements of this list.
