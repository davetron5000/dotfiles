*javax.sound.midi.Patch_Description*

A Patch object represents a location, on a MIDI synthesizer, into which a 
single instrument is stored (loaded). Every Instrument object has its own Patch 
object that specifies the memory location into which that instrument should be 
loaded. The location is specified abstractly by a bank index and a program 
number (not by any scheme that directly refers to a specific address or offset 
in RAM). This is a hierarchical indexing scheme: MIDI provides for up to 16384 
banks, each of which contains up to 128 program locations. For example, a 
minimal sort of synthesizer might have only one bank of instruments, and only 
32 instruments (programs) in that bank. 

To select what instrument should play the notes on a particular MIDI channel, 
two kinds of MIDI message are used that specify a patch location: a bank-select 
command, and a program-change channel command. The Java Sound equivalent is the 
programChange(int, int)(|javax.sound.midi.MidiChannel|) method of MidiChannel. 


*javax.sound.midi.Patch(int,int)*

public Patch(
  int bank,
  int program)

Constructs a new patch object from the specified bank and program numbers. 

    bank - the bank index (in the range from 0 to 16383) 
    program - the program index (in the range from 0 to 127) 

*javax.sound.midi.Patch.getBank()*

public int getBank()

Returns the number of the bank that contains the instrument whose location this 
Patch specifies. 


    Returns: the bank number, whose range is from 0 to 16383 
*javax.sound.midi.Patch.getProgram()*

public int getProgram()

Returns the index, within a bank, of the instrument whose location this Patch 
specifies. 


    Returns: the instrument's program number, whose range is from 0 to 127
