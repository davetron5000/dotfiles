*java.nio.channels.Channel_Description*

A nexus for I/O operations. 

A channel represents an open connection to an entity such as a hardware device, 
a file, a network socket, or a program component that is capable of performing 
one or more distinct I/O operations, for example reading or writing. 

A channel is either open or closed. A channel is open upon creation, and once 
closed it remains closed. Once a channel is closed, any attempt to invoke an 
I/O operation upon it will cause a (|ClosedChannelException|) to be thrown. 
Whether or not a channel is open may be tested by invoking its 
isOpen(|java.nio.channels.Channel|) method. 

Channels are, in general, intended to be safe for multithreaded access as 
described in the specifications of the interfaces and classes that extend and 
implement this interface. 


*java.nio.channels.Channel.close()*

public void close()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Closes this channel. 

After a channel is closed, any further attempt to invoke I/O operations upon it 
will cause a (|ClosedChannelException|) to be thrown. 

If this channel is already closed then invoking this method has no effect. 

This method may be invoked at any time. If some other thread has already 
invoked it, however, then another invocation will block until the first 
invocation is complete, after which it will return without effect. 


*java.nio.channels.Channel.isOpen()*

public boolean isOpen()

Tells whether or not this channel is open. 


    Returns: true if, and only if, this channel is open
