*org.omg.CORBA._PolicyStub()*

public _PolicyStub()

Constructors NOTE: If the default constructor is used, the object is useless 
until _set_delegate (...) is called. 


*org.omg.CORBA._PolicyStub(Delegate)*

public _PolicyStub(org.omg.CORBA.portable.Delegate delegate)

Constructs a _PolicyStub object initialized with the given Delegate object. 

    delegate - a Delegate Object 

*org.omg.CORBA._PolicyStub._ids()*

public |java.lang.String| _ids()




*org.omg.CORBA._PolicyStub.copy()*

public |org.omg.CORBA.Policy| copy()

Copies the policy object. The copy does not retain any relationships that the 
policy had with any domain or object. 


    Returns: the copy of the policy object. 
*org.omg.CORBA._PolicyStub.destroy()*

public void destroy()

Destroys the policy object. It is the responsibility of the policy object to 
determine whether it can be destroyed. 


*org.omg.CORBA._PolicyStub.policy_type()*

public int policy_type()

Returns the constant value that corresponds to the type of the policy object. 
The values of the polivy objectys are allocated by the OMG. New values for 
PolicyType should be obtained from the OMG by sending mail to request@omg.org. 
In general the constant values that are allocated are defined in conjunction 
with the definition of the corresponding policy object. 


    Returns: the constant value that corresponds to the type of the policy object.
