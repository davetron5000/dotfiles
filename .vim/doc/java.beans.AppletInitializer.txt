*java.beans.AppletInitializer_Description*

This interface is designed to work in collusion with 
java.beans.Beans.instantiate. The interafce is intended to provide mechanism to 
allow the proper initialization of JavaBeans that are also Applets, during 
their instantiation by java.beans.Beans.instantiate(). 


*java.beans.AppletInitializer.activate(Applet)*

public void activate(java.applet.Applet newApplet)

Activate, and/or mark Applet active. Implementors of this interface shall mark 
this Applet as active, and optionally invoke its start() method. 

    newApplet - The newly instantiated JavaBean 

*java.beans.AppletInitializer.initialize(Applet,BeanContext)*

public void initialize(
  java.applet.Applet newAppletBean,
  java.beans.beancontext.BeanContext bCtxt)

If passed to the appropriate variant of java.beans.Beans.instantiate this 
method will be called in order to associate the newly instantiated Applet 
(JavaBean) with its AppletContext, AppletStub, and Container. 

Conformant implementations shall: 

Associate the newly instantiated Applet with the appropriate AppletContext. 

Instantiate an AppletStub() and associate that AppletStub with the Applet via 
an invocation of setStub(). 

If BeanContext parameter is null, then it shall associate the Applet with its 
appropriate Container by adding that Applet to its Container via an invocation 
of add(). If the BeanContext parameter is non-null, then it is the 
responsibility of the BeanContext to associate the Applet with its Container 
during the subsequent invocation of its addChildren() method. 



    newAppletBean - The newly instantiated JavaBean 
    bCtxt - The BeanContext intended for this Applet, or null.
