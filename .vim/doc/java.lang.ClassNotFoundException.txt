*java.lang.ClassNotFoundException_Description*

Thrown when an application tries to load in a class through its string name 
using: 

The forName method in class Class. The findSystemClass method in class 
ClassLoader . The loadClass method in class ClassLoader. 

but no definition for the class with the specified name could be found. 

As of release 1.4, this exception has been retrofitted to conform to the 
general purpose exception-chaining mechanism. The "optional exception that was 
raised while loading the class" that may be provided at construction time and 
accessed via the (|java.lang.ClassNotFoundException|) method is now known as 
the cause, and may be accessed via the (|java.lang.Throwable|) method, as well 
as the aforementioned "legacy method." 


*java.lang.ClassNotFoundException()*

public ClassNotFoundException()

Constructs a ClassNotFoundException with no detail message. 


*java.lang.ClassNotFoundException(String)*

public ClassNotFoundException(java.lang.String s)

Constructs a ClassNotFoundException with the specified detail message. 

    s - the detail message. 

*java.lang.ClassNotFoundException(String,Throwable)*

public ClassNotFoundException(
  java.lang.String s,
  java.lang.Throwable ex)

Constructs a ClassNotFoundException with the specified detail message and 
optional exception that was raised while loading the class. 

    s - the detail message 
    ex - the exception that was raised while loading the class 

*java.lang.ClassNotFoundException.getCause()*

public |java.lang.Throwable| getCause()

Returns the cause of this exception (the exception that was raised if an error 
occurred while attempting to load the class; otherwise null). 


    Returns: the cause of this exception. 
*java.lang.ClassNotFoundException.getException()*

public |java.lang.Throwable| getException()

Returns the exception that was raised if an error occurred while attempting to 
load the class. Otherwise, returns null. 

This method predates the general-purpose exception chaining facility. The 
(|java.lang.Throwable|) method is now the preferred means of obtaining this 
information. 


    Returns: the Exception that was raised while loading a class
