*org.omg.CORBA.UNKNOWN_Description*

This exception is raised if an operation implementation throws a non-CORBA 
exception (such as an exception specific to the implementation's programming 
language), or if an operation raises a user exception that does not appear in 
the operation's raises expression. UNKNOWN is also raised if the server returns 
a system exception that is unknown to the client. (This can happen if the 
server uses a later version of CORBA than the client and new system exceptions 
have been added to the later version.) It contains a minor code, which gives 
more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion 
status. It may also contain a string describing the exception. 

See the section Minor Code Meanings to see the minor codes for this exception.
