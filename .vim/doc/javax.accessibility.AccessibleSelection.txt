*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection_Methods*
|javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.addAccessibleSelection(int)|Adds the specified Accessible child of the object to the object's  selection.
|javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.clearAccessibleSelection()|Clears the selection in the object, so that no children in the  object are selected.
|javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.getAccessibleSelection(int)|Returns an Accessible representing the specified selected child  of the object.
|javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.getAccessibleSelectionCount()|Returns the number of Accessible children currently selected.
|javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.isAccessibleChildSelected(int)|Determines if the current child of this object is selected.
|javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.removeAccessibleSelection(int)|Removes the specified child of the object from the object's  selection.
|javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.selectAllAccessibleSelection()|Causes every child of the object to be selected  if the object supports multiple selections.

*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection_Description*

This AccessibleSelection interface provides the standard mechanism for an assistive technology to determine what the current selected children are, as well as modify the selection 
set. Any object that has children that can be selected should support the AccessibleSelection interface. Applications can determine if an object supports the AccessibleSelection 
interface by first obtaining its AccessibleContext (see (|javax.accessibility.Accessible|) ) and then calling the (|javax.accessibility.AccessibleContext|) method. If the return 
value is not null, the object supports this interface. 



*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.addAccessibleSelection(int)*

public void addAccessibleSelection(int i)

Adds the specified Accessible child of the object to the object's selection. If the object supports multiple selections, the specified child is added to any existing selection, 
otherwise it replaces any existing selection in the object. If the specified child is already selected, this method has no effect. 


    i - the zero-based index of the child 

*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.clearAccessibleSelection()*

public void clearAccessibleSelection()

Clears the selection in the object, so that no children in the object are selected. 



*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.getAccessibleSelection(int)*

public |javax.accessibility.Accessible| getAccessibleSelection(int i)

Returns an Accessible representing the specified selected child of the object. If there isn't a selection, or there are fewer children selected than the integer passed in, the 
return value will be null. Note that the index represents the i-th selected child, which is different from the i-th child. 


    i - the zero-based index of selected children 

    Returns: the i-th selected child 

*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.getAccessibleSelectionCount()*

public int getAccessibleSelectionCount()

Returns the number of Accessible children currently selected. If no children are selected, the return value will be 0. 



    Returns: the number of items currently selected. 

*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.isAccessibleChildSelected(int)*

public boolean isAccessibleChildSelected(int i)

Determines if the current child of this object is selected. 


    i - the zero-based index of the child in this Accessible object. 

    Returns: true if the current child of this object is selected; else false. 

*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.removeAccessibleSelection(int)*

public void removeAccessibleSelection(int i)

Removes the specified child of the object from the object's selection. If the specified item isn't currently selected, this method has no effect. 


    i - the zero-based index of the child 

*javax.accessibility.AccessibleSelection.selectAllAccessibleSelection()*

public void selectAllAccessibleSelection()

Causes every child of the object to be selected if the object supports multiple selections.
