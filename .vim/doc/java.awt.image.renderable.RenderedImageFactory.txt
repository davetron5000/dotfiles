*java.awt.image.renderable.RenderedImageFactory_Description*

The RenderedImageFactory interface (often abbreviated RIF) is intended to be 
implemented by classes that wish to act as factories to produce different 
renderings, for example by executing a series of BufferedImageOps on a set of 
sources, depending on a specific set of parameters, properties, and rendering 
hints. 


*java.awt.image.renderable.RenderedImageFactory.create(ParameterBlock,RenderingHints)*

public |java.awt.image.RenderedImage| create(
  java.awt.image.renderable.ParameterBlock paramBlock,
  java.awt.RenderingHints hints)

Creates a RenderedImage representing the results of an imaging operation (or 
chain of operations) for a given ParameterBlock and RenderingHints. The RIF may 
also query any source images referenced by the ParameterBlock for their 
dimensions, SampleModels, properties, etc., as necessary. 

The create() method can return null if the RenderedImageFactory is not capable 
of producing output for the given set of source images and parameters. For 
example, if a RenderedImageFactory is only capable of performing a 3x3 
convolution on single-banded image data, and the source image has multiple 
bands or the convolution Kernel is 5x5, null should be returned. 

Hints should be taken into account, but can be ignored. The created 
RenderedImage may have a property identified by the String HINTS_OBSERVED to 
indicate which RenderingHints were used to create the image. In addition any 
RenderedImages that are obtained via the getSources() method on the created 
RenderedImage may have such a property. 

    paramBlock - a ParameterBlock containing sources and parameters for the RenderedImage to be 
       created. 
    hints - a RenderingHints object containing hints. 

    Returns: A RenderedImage containing the desired output.
