*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason_Description*

Class JobStateReason is a printing attribute class, an enumeration, that 
provides additional information about the job's current state, i.e., 
information that augments the value of the job's 
JobState(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobState|) attribute. Class 
JobStateReason defines standard job state reason values. A Print Service 
implementation only needs to report those job state reasons which are 
appropriate for the particular implementation; it does not have to report every 
defined job state reason. 

Instances of JobStateReason do not appear in a Print Job's attribute set 
directly. Rather, a 
JobStateReasons(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons|) attribute 
appears in the Print Job's attribute set. The 
JobStateReasons(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons|) attribute 
contains zero, one, or more than one JobStateReason objects which pertain to 
the Print Job's status. The printer adds a JobStateReason object to the Print 
Job's JobStateReasons(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons|) 
attribute when the corresponding condition becomes true of the Print Job, and 
the printer removes the JobStateReason object again when the corresponding 
condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Job's overall 
JobState(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobState|) also changed. 

IPP Compatibility: The category name returned by getName() is the IPP attribute 
name. The enumeration's integer value is the IPP enum value. The toString() 
method returns the IPP string representation of the attribute value.
