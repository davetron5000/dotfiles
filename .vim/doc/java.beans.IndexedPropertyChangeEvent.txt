*java.beans.IndexedPropertyChangeEvent_Description*

An "IndexedPropertyChange" event gets delivered whenever a component that 
conforms to the JavaBeans specification (a "bean") changes a bound indexed 
property. This class is an extension of PropertyChangeEvent but contains the 
index of the property that has changed. 

Null values may be provided for the old and the new values if their true values 
are not known. 

An event source may send a null object as the name to indicate that an 
arbitrary set of if its properties have changed. In this case the old and new 
values should also be null.

  java.lang.Object source,
  java.lang.String propertyName,

  java.lang.Object newValue,

    source - The bean that fired the event.
