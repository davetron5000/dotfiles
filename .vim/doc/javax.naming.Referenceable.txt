*javax.naming.Referenceable_Description*

This interface is implemented by an object that can provide a Reference to 
itself. 

A Reference represents a way of recording address information about objects 
which themselves are not directly bound to the naming system. Such objects can 
implement the Referenceable interface as a way for programs that use that 
object to determine what its Reference is. For example, when binding a object, 
if an object implements the Referenceable interface, getReference() can be 
invoked on the object to get its Reference to use for binding.
