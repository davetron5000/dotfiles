PrintGraphics interface. 



*java.awt.PrintJob.getPageDimension()*

public abstract |java.awt.Dimension| getPageDimension()

Returns the dimensions of the page in pixels. The resolution of the page is chosen so that it is similar to the screen resolution. 



*java.awt.PrintJob.getPageResolution()*

public abstract int getPageResolution()

Returns the resolution of the page in pixels per inch. Note that this doesn't have to correspond to the physical resolution of the printer.
