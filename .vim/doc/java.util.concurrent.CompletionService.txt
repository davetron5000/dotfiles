*java.util.concurrent.CompletionService_Description*

A service that decouples the production of new asynchronous tasks from the consumption of the results of completed tasks. Producers submit tasks for execution. Consumers take 
completed tasks and process their results in the order they complete. A CompletionService can for example be used to manage asynchronous IO, in which tasks that perform reads are 
submitted in one part of a program or system, and then acted upon in a different part of the program when the reads complete, possibly in a different order than they were 
requested. 



Typically, a CompletionService relies on a separate (|java.util.concurrent.Executor|) to actually execute the tasks, in which case the CompletionService only manages an internal 
completion queue. The (|java.util.concurrent.ExecutorCompletionService|) class provides an implementation of this approach. 



*java.util.concurrent.CompletionService.poll()*

public |java.util.concurrent.Future|<V> poll()

Retrieves and removes the Future representing the next completed task or null if none are present. 



    Returns: the Future representing the next completed task, or null if none are present. 

*java.util.concurrent.CompletionService.poll(long,TimeUnit)*

public |java.util.concurrent.Future|<V> poll(
  long timeout,
  java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit unit)
  throws |java.lang.InterruptedException|
         
Retrieves and removes the Future representing the next completed task, waiting if necessary up to the specified wait time if none are yet present. 


    timeout - how long to wait before giving up, in units of unit 
    unit - a TimeUnit determining how to interpret the timeout parameter 

    Returns: the Future representing the next completed task or null if the specified waiting time elapses before one is present. 

*java.util.concurrent.CompletionService.submit(Callable<V>)*

public |java.util.concurrent.Future|<V> submit(java.util.concurrent.Callable<V> task)

Submits a value-returning task for execution and returns a Future representing the pending results of the task. Upon completion, this task may be taken or polled. 


    task - the task to submit 

    Returns: a Future representing pending completion of the task 

*java.util.concurrent.CompletionService.submit(Runnable,V)*

public |java.util.concurrent.Future|<V> submit(
  java.lang.Runnable task,
  V result)

Submits a Runnable task for execution and returns a Future representing that task.Upon completion, this task may be taken or polled. 


    task - the task to submit 
    result - the result to return upon successful completion 

    Returns: a Future representing pending completion of the task, and whose get() method will return the given result value upon completion 

*java.util.concurrent.CompletionService.take()*

public |java.util.concurrent.Future|<V> take()
  throws |java.lang.InterruptedException|
         
Retrieves and removes the Future representing the next completed task, waiting if none are yet present. 



    Returns: the Future representing the next completed task
