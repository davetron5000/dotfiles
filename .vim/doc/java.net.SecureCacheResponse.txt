Represents a cache response originally retrieved through secure means, such as 
TLS.

public SecureCacheResponse()




*java.net.SecureCacheResponse.getCipherSuite()*

public abstract |java.lang.String| getCipherSuite()

Returns the cipher suite in use on the original connection that retrieved the 
network resource. 


    Returns: a string representing the cipher suite 
*java.net.SecureCacheResponse.getLocalCertificateChain()*

public abstract |java.util.List| getLocalCertificateChain()

Returns the certificate chain that were sent to the server during handshaking 
of the original connection that retrieved the network resource. Note: This 
method is useful only when using certificate-based cipher suites. 


    Returns: an immutable List of Certificate representing the certificate chain that was 
             sent to the server. If no certificate chain was sent, null will be 
             returned. 
*java.net.SecureCacheResponse.getLocalPrincipal()*

public abstract |java.security.Principal| getLocalPrincipal()

Returns the principal that was sent to the server during handshaking in the 
original connection that retrieved the network resource. 


    Returns: the principal sent to the server. Returns an X500Principal of the end-entity 
             certificate for X509-based cipher suites, and KerberosPrincipal 
             for Kerberos cipher suites. If no principal was sent, then null is 
             returned. 
*java.net.SecureCacheResponse.getPeerPrincipal()*

public abstract |java.security.Principal| getPeerPrincipal()
  throws |javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException|
         
Returns the server's principal which was established as part of defining the 
session during the original connection that retrieved the network resource. 


    Returns: the server's principal. Returns an X500Principal of the end-entity certiticate 
             for X509-based cipher suites, and KerberosPrincipal for Kerberos 
             cipher suites. 
*java.net.SecureCacheResponse.getServerCertificateChain()*

public abstract |java.util.List| getServerCertificateChain()
  throws |javax.net.ssl.SSLPeerUnverifiedException|
         
Returns the server's certificate chain, which was established as part of 
defining the session in the original connection that retrieved the network 
resource, from cache. Note: This method can be used only when using 
certificate-based cipher suites; using it with non-certificate-based cipher 
suites, such as Kerberos, will throw an SSLPeerUnverifiedException. 


    Returns: an immutable List of Certificate representing the server's certificate chain.
