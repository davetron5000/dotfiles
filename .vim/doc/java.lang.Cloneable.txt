*java.lang.Cloneable_Description*

A class implements the Cloneable interface to indicate to the 
(|java.lang.Object|) method that it is legal for that method to make a 
field-for-field copy of instances of that class. 

Invoking Object's clone method on an instance that does not implement the 
Cloneable interface results in the exception CloneNotSupportedException being 
thrown. 

By convention, classes that implement this interface should override 
Object.clone (which is protected) with a public method. See 
(|java.lang.Object|) for details on overriding this method. 

Note that this interface does not contain the clone method. Therefore, it is 
not possible to clone an object merely by virtue of the fact that it implements 
this interface. Even if the clone method is invoked reflectively, there is no 
guarantee that it will succeed.
