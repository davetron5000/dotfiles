*javax.persistence.AssociationOverride_Description*

This annotation is used to override a many-to-one or one-to-one mapping of 
property or field for an entity relationship. 

The AssociationOverride annotation may be applied to an entity that extends a 
mapped superclass to override a many-to-one or one-to-one mapping defined by 
the mapped superclass. If the AssociationOverride annotation is not specified, 
the join column is mapped the same as in the original mapping. 

Example: MappedSuperclass public class Employee { ... ManyToOne protected 
Address address; ... } 

Entity AssociationOverride(name="address", 
joinColumns=JoinColumn(name="ADDR_ID")) // address field mapping overridden to 
ADDR_ID fk public class PartTimeEmployee extends Employee { ... }
