*java.sql.SQLInput_Description*

An input stream that contains a stream of values representing an instance of an SQL structured type or an SQL distinct type. This interface, used only for custom mapping, is used 
by the driver behind the scenes, and a programmer never directly invokes SQLInput methods. The reader methods (readLong, readBytes, and so on) provide a way to read the values in 
an SQLInput object. The method wasNull is used to determine whether the the last value read was SQL NULL. When the method getObject is called with an object of a class 
implementing the interface SQLData, the JDBC driver calls the method SQLData.getSQLType to determine the SQL type of the user-defined type (UDT) being custom mapped. The driver 
creates an instance of SQLInput, populating it with the attributes of the UDT. The driver then passes the input stream to the method SQLData.readSQL, which in turn calls the 
SQLInput reader methods in its implementation for reading the attributes from the input stream.

*java.sql.SQLInput.readObject()*

public |java.lang.Object| readObject()
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Reads the datum at the head of the stream and returns it as an Object in the Java programming language. The actual type of the object returned is determined by the default type 
mapping, and any customizations present in this stream's type map. 

A type map is registered with the stream by the JDBC driver before the stream is passed to the application. 

When the datum at the head of the stream is an SQL NULL, the method returns null. If the datum is an SQL structured or distinct type, it determines the SQL type of the datum at 
the head of the stream. If the stream's type map has an entry for that SQL type, the driver constructs an object of the appropriate class and calls the method SQLData.readSQL on 
that object, which reads additional data from the stream, using the protocol described for that method.
