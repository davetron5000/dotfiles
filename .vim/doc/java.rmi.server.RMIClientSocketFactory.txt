*java.rmi.server.RMIClientSocketFactory_Description*

An RMIClientSocketFactory instance is used by the RMI runtime in order to obtain client sockets for RMI calls. A remote object can be associated with an RMIClientSocketFactory 
when it is created/exported via the constructors or exportObject methods of java.rmi.server.UnicastRemoteObject and java.rmi.activation.Activatable . 

An RMIClientSocketFactory instance associated with a remote object will be downloaded to clients when the remote object's reference is transmitted in an RMI call. This 
RMIClientSocketFactory will be used to create connections to the remote object for remote method calls. 

An RMIClientSocketFactory instance can also be associated with a remote object registry so that clients can use custom socket communication with a remote object registry. 

An implementation of this interface should be serializable and should implement (|java.lang.Object|) to return true when passed an instance that represents the same (functionally 
equivalent) client socket factory, and false otherwise (and it should also implement (|java.lang.Object|) consistently with its Object.equals implementation). 



*java.rmi.server.RMIClientSocketFactory.createSocket(String,int)*

public |java.net.Socket| createSocket(
  java.lang.String host,
  int port)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Create a client socket connected to the specified host and port. 


    host - the host name 
    port - the port number 

    Returns: a socket connected to the specified host and port.
