*org.omg.CORBA.portable.IndirectionException_Description*

The Indirection exception is a Java specific system exception. It is thrown 
when the ORB's input stream is called to demarshal a value that is encoded as 
an indirection that is in the process of being demarshaled. This can occur when 
the ORB input stream calls the ValueHandler to demarshal an RMI value whose 
state contains a recursive reference to itself. Because the top-level 
ValueHandler.read_value() call has not yet returned a value, the ORB input 
stream's indirection table does not contain an entry for an object with the 
stream offset specified by the indirection tag. The stream offset is returned 
in the exception's offset field.

public IndirectionException(int offset)

Creates an IndirectionException with the right offset value. The stream offset 
is returned in the exception's offset field. This exception is constructed and 
thrown during reading recursively defined values off of a stream. 

    offset - the stream offset where recursion is detected.
