*java.awt.dnd.MouseDragGestureRecognizer_Description*

This abstract subclass of DragGestureRecognizer defines a DragGestureRecognizer for mouse-based gestures. 

Each platform implements its own concrete subclass of this class, available via the Toolkit.createDragGestureRecognizer() method, to encapsulate the recognition of the platform 
dependent mouse gesture(s) that initiate a Drag and Drop operation. 

Mouse drag gesture recognizers should honor the drag gesture motion threshold, available through (|java.awt.dnd.DragSource|) . A drag gesture should be recognized only when the 
distance in either the horizontal or vertical direction between the location of the latest mouse dragged event and the location of the corresponding mouse button pressed event is 
greater than the drag gesture motion threshold. 

Drag gesture recognizers created with (|java.awt.dnd.DragSource|) follow this convention. 



*java.awt.dnd.MouseDragGestureRecognizer(DragSource)*

protected MouseDragGestureRecognizer(java.awt.dnd.DragSource ds)

    ds - The DragSource for the Component 

*java.awt.dnd.MouseDragGestureRecognizer(DragSource,Component)*

protected MouseDragGestureRecognizer(
  java.awt.dnd.DragSource ds,
  java.awt.Component c)

Construct a new MouseDragGestureRecognizer given the DragSource for the Component c, and the Component to observe. 

    ds - The DragSource for the Component c 
    c - The Component to observe 

*java.awt.dnd.MouseDragGestureRecognizer(DragSource,Component,int)*

protected MouseDragGestureRecognizer(
  java.awt.dnd.DragSource ds,
  java.awt.Component c,
  int act)

Construct a new MouseDragGestureRecognizer given the DragSource for the Component c, the Component to observe, and the action(s) permitted for this drag operation. 

    ds - The DragSource for the Component c 
    c - The Component to observe 
    act - The actions permitted for this drag 

*java.awt.dnd.MouseDragGestureRecognizer(DragSource,Component,int,DragGestureListener)*

protected MouseDragGestureRecognizer(
  java.awt.dnd.DragSource ds,
  java.awt.Component c,
  int act,
  java.awt.dnd.DragGestureListener dgl)

Construct a new MouseDragGestureRecognizer given the DragSource for the Component c, the Component to observe, the action(s) permitted for this drag operation, and the 
DragGestureListener to notify when a drag gesture is detected. 

    ds - The DragSource for the Component c 
    c - The Component to observe 
    act - The actions permitted for this Drag 
    dgl - The DragGestureListener to notify when a gesture is detected
