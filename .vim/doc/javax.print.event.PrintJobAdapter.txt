*javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter_Description*

An abstract adapter class for receiving print job events. The methods in this class are empty. This class exists as a convenience for creating listener objects. Extend this class 
to create a (|javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent|) listener and override the methods for the events of interest. Unlike the ComponentListener(|java.awt.event.ComponentListener|) 
interface, this abstract interface provides null methods so that you only need to define the methods you need, rather than all of the methods. 



*javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter()*

public PrintJobAdapter()




*javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter.printDataTransferCompleted(PrintJobEvent)*

public void printDataTransferCompleted(javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent pje)

Called to notify the client that data has been successfully transferred to the print service, and the client may free local resources allocated for that data. The client should 
not assume that the data has been completely printed after receiving this event. 


    pje - the event being notified 

*javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter.printJobCanceled(PrintJobEvent)*

public void printJobCanceled(javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent pje)

Called to notify the client that the job was canceled by user or program. 


    pje - the event being notified 

*javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter.printJobCompleted(PrintJobEvent)*

public void printJobCompleted(javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent pje)

Called to notify the client that the job completed successfully. 


    pje - the event being notified 

*javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter.printJobFailed(PrintJobEvent)*

public void printJobFailed(javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent pje)

Called to notify the client that the job failed to complete successfully and will have to be resubmitted. 


    pje - the event being notified 

*javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter.printJobNoMoreEvents(PrintJobEvent)*

public void printJobNoMoreEvents(javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent pje)

Called to notify the client that no more events will be delivered. One cause of this event being generated is if the job has successfully completed, but the printing system is 
limited in capability and cannot verify this. This event is required to be delivered if none of the other terminal events (completed/failed/canceled) are delivered. 


    pje - the event being notified 

*javax.print.event.PrintJobAdapter.printJobRequiresAttention(PrintJobEvent)*

public void printJobRequiresAttention(javax.print.event.PrintJobEvent pje)

Called to notify the client that some possibly user rectifiable problem occurs (eg printer out of paper). 


    pje - the event being notified
