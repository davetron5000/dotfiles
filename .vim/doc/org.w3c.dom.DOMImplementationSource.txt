*org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementationSource_Description*

This interface permits a DOM implementer to supply one or more implementations, 
based upon requested features and versions, as specified in . Each implemented 
DOMImplementationSource object is listed in the binding-specific list of 
available sources so that its DOMImplementation objects are made available. See 
also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification. 


*org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementationSource.getDOMImplementation(String)*

public |org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementation| getDOMImplementation(java.lang.String features)

A method to request the first DOM implementation that supports the specified 
features. 

    features - A string that specifies which features and versions are required. This is a 
       space separated list in which each feature is specified by its name 
       optionally followed by a space and a version number. This method returns 
       the first item of the list returned by getDOMImplementationList. As an 
       example, the string "XML 3.0 Traversal +Events 2.0" will request a DOM 
       implementation that supports the module "XML" for its 3.0 version, a 
       module that support of the "Traversal" module for any version, and the 
       module "Events" for its 2.0 version. The module "Events" must be 
       accessible using the method Node.getFeature() and 
       DOMImplementation.getFeature(). 

    Returns: The first DOM implementation that support the desired features, or null if this 
             source has none. 
*org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementationSource.getDOMImplementationList(String)*

public |org.w3c.dom.DOMImplementationList| getDOMImplementationList(java.lang.String features)

A method to request a list of DOM implementations that support the specified 
features and versions, as specified in . 

    features - A string that specifies which features and versions are required. This is a 
       space separated list in which each feature is specified by its name 
       optionally followed by a space and a version number. This is something 
       like: "XML 3.0 Traversal +Events 2.0" 

    Returns: A list of DOM implementations that support the desired features.
