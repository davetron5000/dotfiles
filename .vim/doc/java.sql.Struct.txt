*java.sql.Struct_Description*

The standard mapping in the Java programming language for an SQL structured 
type. A Struct object contains a value for each attribute of the SQL structured 
type that it represents. By default, an instance ofStruct is valid as long as 
the application has a reference to it. 


*java.sql.Struct.getAttributes()*

public |java.lang.Object| getAttributes()
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Produces the ordered values of the attributes of the SQL structurec type that 
this Struct object represents. This method uses the type map associated with 
the connection for customizations of the type mappings. If there is no entry in 
the connection's type map that matches the structured type that this Struct 
object represents, the driver uses the standard mapping. 

Conceptually, this method calls the method getObject on each attribute of the 
structured type and returns a Java array containing the result. 


    Returns: an array containing the ordered attribute values 
*java.sql.Struct.getAttributes(Map)*

public |java.lang.Object| getAttributes(java.util.Map map)
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Produces the ordered values of the attributes of the SQL structurec type that 
this Struct object represents. This method uses the given type map for 
customizations of the type mappings. If there is no entry in the given type map 
that matches the structured type that this Struct object represents, the driver 
uses the standard mapping. This method never uses the type map associated with 
the connection. 

Conceptually, this method calls the method getObject on each attribute of the 
structured type and returns a Java array containing the result. 

    map - a mapping of SQL type names to Java classes 

    Returns: an array containing the ordered attribute values 
*java.sql.Struct.getSQLTypeName()*

public |java.lang.String| getSQLTypeName()
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Retrieves the SQL type name of the SQL structured type that this Struct object 
represents. 


    Returns: the fully-qualified type name of the SQL structured type for which this Struct 
             object is the generic representation
