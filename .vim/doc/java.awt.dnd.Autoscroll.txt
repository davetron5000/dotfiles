*java.awt.dnd.Autoscroll_Description*

During DnD operations it is possible that a user may wish to drop the subject 
of the operation on a region of a scrollable GUI control that is not currently 
visible to the user. 

In such situations it is desirable that the GUI control detect this and 
institute a scroll operation in order to make obscured region(s) visible to the 
user. This feature is known as autoscrolling. 

If a GUI control is both an active DropTarget and is also scrollable, it can 
receive notifications of autoscrolling gestures by the user from the DnD system 
by implementing this interface. 

An autoscrolling gesture is initiated by the user by keeping the drag cursor 
motionless with a border region of the Component, referred to as the 
"autoscrolling region", for a predefined period of time, this will result in 
repeated scroll requests to the Component until the drag Cursor resumes its 
motion. 


*java.awt.dnd.Autoscroll.autoscroll(Point)*

public void autoscroll(java.awt.Point cursorLocn)

notify the Component to autoscroll 

    cursorLocn - A Point indicating the location of the cursor that triggered this operation. 

*java.awt.dnd.Autoscroll.getAutoscrollInsets()*

public |java.awt.Insets| getAutoscrollInsets()

This method returns the Insets describing the autoscrolling region or border 
relative to the geometry of the implementing Component. 

This value is read once by the DropTarget upon entry of the drag Cursor into 
the associated Component. 


    Returns:
