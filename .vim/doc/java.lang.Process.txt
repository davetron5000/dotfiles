*java.lang.Process_Description*

The (|java.lang.ProcessBuilder|) and Runtime.exec(|java.lang.Runtime|) methods create a native process and return an instance of a subclass of Process that can be used to control 
the process and obtain information about it. The class Process provides methods for performing input from the process, performing output to the process, waiting for the process to 
complete, checking the exit status of the process, and destroying (killing) the process. 

The methods that create processes may not work well for special processes on certain native platforms, such as native windowing processes, daemon processes, Win16/DOS processes on 
Microsoft Windows, or shell scripts. The created subprocess does not have its own terminal or console. All its standard io (i.e. stdin, stdout, stderr) operations will be 
redirected to the parent process through three streams ( (|java.lang.Process|) , (|java.lang.Process|) , (|java.lang.Process|) ). The parent process uses these streams to feed 
input to and get output from the subprocess. Because some native platforms only provide limited buffer size for standard input and output streams, failure to promptly write the 
input stream or read the output stream of the subprocess may cause the subprocess to block, and even deadlock. 

The subprocess is not killed when there are no more references to the Process object, but rather the subprocess continues executing asynchronously. 

There is no requirement that a process represented by a Process object execute asynchronously or concurrently with respect to the Java process that owns the Process object. 



*java.lang.Process()*

public Process()




*java.lang.Process.destroy()*

public abstract void destroy()

Kills the subprocess. The subprocess represented by this Process object is forcibly terminated. 



*java.lang.Process.exitValue()*

public abstract int exitValue()

Returns the exit value for the subprocess. 



    Returns: the exit value of the subprocess represented by this Process object. by convention, the value 0 indicates normal termination. 

*java.lang.Process.getErrorStream()*

public abstract |java.io.InputStream| getErrorStream()

Gets the error stream of the subprocess. The stream obtains data piped from the error output stream of the process represented by this Process object. 

Implementation note: It is a good idea for the input stream to be buffered. 



    Returns: the input stream connected to the error stream of the subprocess. 

*java.lang.Process.getInputStream()*

public abstract |java.io.InputStream| getInputStream()

Gets the input stream of the subprocess. The stream obtains data piped from the standard output stream of the process represented by this Process object. 

Implementation note: It is a good idea for the input stream to be buffered. 



    Returns: the input stream connected to the normal output of the subprocess. 

*java.lang.Process.getOutputStream()*

public abstract |java.io.OutputStream| getOutputStream()

Gets the output stream of the subprocess. Output to the stream is piped into the standard input stream of the process represented by this Process object. 

Implementation note: It is a good idea for the output stream to be buffered. 



    Returns: the output stream connected to the normal input of the subprocess. 

*java.lang.Process.waitFor()*

public abstract int waitFor()
  throws |java.lang.InterruptedException|
         
causes the current thread to wait, if necessary, until the process represented by this Process object has terminated. This method returns immediately if the subprocess has already 
terminated. If the subprocess has not yet terminated, the calling thread will be blocked until the subprocess exits. 



    Returns: the exit value of the process. By convention, 0 indicates normal termination.
