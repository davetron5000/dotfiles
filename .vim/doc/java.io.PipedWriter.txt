*java.io.PipedWriter_Constructors*
|java.io.PipedWriter()|Creates a piped writer that is not yet connected to a   piped reader.
|java.io.PipedWriter(PipedReader)|Creates a piped writer connected to the specified piped   reader.

*java.io.PipedWriter_Methods*
|java.io.PipedWriter.close()|Closes this piped output stream and releases any system resources   associated with this stream.
|java.io.PipedWriter.connect(PipedReader)|Connects this piped writer to a receiver.
|java.io.PipedWriter.flush()|Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output characters   to be written out.
|java.io.PipedWriter.write(char[],int,int)|Writes len characters from the specified character array   starting at offset off to this piped output stream.
|java.io.PipedWriter.write(int)|Writes the specified char to the piped output stream.

*java.io.PipedWriter_Description*

Piped character-output streams. 



*java.io.PipedWriter()*

public PipedWriter()

Creates a piped writer that is not yet connected to a piped reader. It must be connected to a piped reader, either by the receiver or the sender, before being used. 


*java.io.PipedWriter(PipedReader)*

public PipedWriter(java.io.PipedReader snk)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Creates a piped writer connected to the specified piped reader. Data characters written to this stream will then be available as input from snk. 

    snk - The piped reader to connect to. 

*java.io.PipedWriter.close()*

public void close()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Closes this piped output stream and releases any system resources associated with this stream. This stream may no longer be used for writing characters. 



*java.io.PipedWriter.connect(PipedReader)*

public synchronized void connect(java.io.PipedReader snk)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Connects this piped writer to a receiver. If this object is already connected to some other piped reader, an IOException is thrown. 

If snk is an unconnected piped reader and src is an unconnected piped writer, they may be connected by either the call: 

src.connect(snk) 

or the call: 

snk.connect(src) 

The two calls have the same effect. 


    snk - the piped reader to connect to. 

*java.io.PipedWriter.flush()*

public synchronized void flush()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Flushes this output stream and forces any buffered output characters to be written out. This will notify any readers that characters are waiting in the pipe. 



*java.io.PipedWriter.write(char[],int,int)*

public void write(
  char[] cbuf,
  int off,
  int len)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes len characters from the specified character array starting at offset off to this piped output stream. If a thread was reading data characters from the connected piped input 
stream, but the thread is no longer alive, then an IOException is thrown. 


    cbuf - the data. 
    off - the start offset in the data. 
    len - the number of characters to write. 

*java.io.PipedWriter.write(int)*

public void write(int c)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes the specified char to the piped output stream. If a thread was reading data characters from the connected piped input stream, but the thread is no longer alive, then an 
IOException is thrown. 

Implements the write method of Writer. 


    c - the char to be written.
