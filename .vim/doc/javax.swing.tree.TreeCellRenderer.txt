*javax.swing.tree.TreeCellRenderer_Description*

Defines the requirements for an object that displays a tree node. See How to 
Use Trees in The Java Tutorial for an example of implementing a tree cell 
renderer that displays custom icons. 


*javax.swing.tree.TreeCellRenderer.getTreeCellRendererComponent(JTree,Object,boolean,boolean,boolean,int,boolean)*

public |java.awt.Component| getTreeCellRendererComponent(
  javax.swing.JTree tree,
  java.lang.Object value,
  boolean selected,
  boolean expanded,
  boolean leaf,
  int row,
  boolean hasFocus)

Sets the value of the current tree cell to value. If selected is true, the cell 
will be drawn as if selected. If expanded is true the node is currently 
expanded and if leaf is true the node represets a leaf and if hasFocus is true 
the node currently has focus. tree is the JTree the receiver is being 
configured for. Returns the Component that the renderer uses to draw the value. 


    Returns: the Component that the renderer uses to draw the value
