*javax.accessibility.AccessibleState_Description*

Class AccessibleState describes a component's particular state. The actual 
state of the component is defined as an AccessibleStateSet, which is a composed 
set of AccessibleStates. The toDisplayString method allows you to obtain the 
localized string for a locale independent key from a predefined ResourceBundle 
for the keys defined in this class. The constants in this class present a 
strongly typed enumeration of common object roles. A public constructor for 
this class has been purposely omitted and applications should use one of the 
constants from this class. If the constants in this class are not sufficient to 
describe the role of an object, a subclass should be generated from this class 
and it should provide constants in a similar manner.

*javax.accessibility.AccessibleState(String)*

protected AccessibleState(java.lang.String key)

Creates a new AccessibleState using the given locale independent key. This 
should not be a public method. Instead, it is used to create the constants in 
this file to make it a strongly typed enumeration. Subclasses of this class 
should enforce similar policy. 

The key String should be a locale independent key for the state. It is not 
intended to be used as the actual String to display to the user. To get the 
localized string, use toDisplayString. 

    key - the locale independent name of the state.
