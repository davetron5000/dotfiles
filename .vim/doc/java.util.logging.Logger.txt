*java.util.logging.Logger_Description*

A Logger object is used to log messages for a specific system or application component. Loggers are normally named, using a hierarchical dot-separated namespace. Logger names can 
be arbitrary strings, but they should normally be based on the package name or class name of the logged component, such as java.net or javax.swing. In addition it is possible to 
create "anonymous" Loggers that are not stored in the Logger namespace. 

Logger objects may be obtained by calls on one of the getLogger factory methods. These will either create a new Logger or return a suitable existing Logger. 

Logging messages will be forwarded to registered Handler objects, which can forward the messages to a variety of destinations, including consoles, files, OS logs, etc. 

Each Logger keeps track of a "parent" Logger, which is its nearest existing ancestor in the Logger namespace. 

Each Logger has a "Level" associated with it. This reflects a minimum Level that this logger cares about. If a Logger's level is set to null, then its effective level is inherited 
from its parent, which may in turn obtain it recursively from its parent, and so on up the tree. 

The log level can be configured based on the properties from the logging configuration file, as described in the description of the LogManager class. However it may also be 
dynamically changed by calls on the Logger.setLevel method. If a logger's level is changed the change may also affect child loggers, since any child logger that has null as its 
level will inherit its effective level from its parent. 

On each logging call the Logger initially performs a cheap check of the request level (e.g. SEVERE or FINE) against the effective log level of the logger. If the request level is 
lower than the log level, the logging call returns immediately. 

After passing this initial (cheap) test, the Logger will allocate a LogRecord to describe the logging message. It will then call a Filter (if present) to do a more detailed check 
on whether the record should be published. If that passes it will then publish the LogRecord to its output Handlers. By default, loggers also publish to their parent's Handlers, 
recursively up the tree. 

Each Logger may have a ResourceBundle name associated with it. The named bundle will be used for localizing logging messages. If a Logger does not have its own ResourceBundle 
name, then it will inherit the ResourceBundle name from its parent, recursively up the tree. 

Most of the logger output methods take a "msg" argument. This msg argument may be either a raw value or a localization key. During formatting, if the logger has (or inherits) a 
localization ResourceBundle and if the ResourceBundle has a mapping for the msg string, then the msg string is replaced by the localized value. Otherwise the original msg string 
is used. Typically, formatters use java.text.MessageFormat style formatting to format parameters, so for example a format string "{0} {1}" would format two parameters as strings. 

When mapping ResourceBundle names to ResourceBundles, the Logger will first try to use the Thread's ContextClassLoader. If that is null it will try the SystemClassLoader instead. 
As a temporary transition feature in the initial implementation, if the Logger is unable to locate a ResourceBundle from the ContextClassLoader or SystemClassLoader the Logger 
will also search up the class stack and use successive calling ClassLoaders to try to locate a ResourceBundle. (This call stack search is to allow containers to transition to 
using ContextClassLoaders and is likely to be removed in future versions.) 

Formatting (including localization) is the responsibility of the output Handler, which will typically call a Formatter. 

Note that formatting need not occur synchronously. It may be delayed until a LogRecord is actually written to an external sink. 

The logging methods are grouped in five main categories: 

There are a set of "log" methods that take a log level, a message string, and optionally some parameters to the message string. 

There are a set of "logp" methods (for "log precise") that are like the "log" methods, but also take an explicit source class name and method name. 

There are a set of "logrb" method (for "log with resource bundle") that are like the "logp" method, but also take an explicit resource bundle name for use in localizing the log 
message. 

There are convenience methods for tracing method entries (the "entering" methods), method returns (the "exiting" methods) and throwing exceptions (the "throwing" methods). 

Finally, there are a set of convenience methods for use in the very simplest cases, when a developer simply wants to log a simple string at a given log level. These methods are 
named after the standard Level names ("severe", "warning", "info", etc.) and take a single argument, a message string. 

For the methods that do not take an explicit source name and method name, the Logging framework will make a "best effort" to determine which class and method called into the 
logging method. However, it is important to realize that this automatically inferred information may only be approximate (or may even be quite wrong!). Virtual machines are 
allowed to do extensive optimizations when JITing and may entirely remove stack frames, making it impossible to reliably locate the calling class and method. 

All methods on Logger are multi-thread safe. 

Subclassing Information: Note that a LogManager class may provide its own implementation of named Loggers for any point in the namespace. Therefore, any subclasses of Logger 
(unless they are implemented in conjunction with a new LogManager class) should take care to obtain a Logger instance from the LogManager class and should delegate operations such 
as "isLoggable" and "log(LogRecord)" to that instance. Note that in order to intercept all logging output, subclasses need only override the log(LogRecord) method. All the other 
logging methods are implemented as calls on this log(LogRecord) method. 



*java.util.logging.Logger_java.util.logging.Logger.global*

The "global" Logger object is provided as a convenience to developers who are making casual use of the Logging package. Developers who are making serious use of the logging 
package (for example in products) should create and use their own Logger objects, with appropriate names, so that logging can be controlled on a suitable per-Logger granularity. 

The global logger is initialized by calling Logger.getLogger("global").

*java.util.logging.Logger.getAnonymousLogger()*

public static synchronized |java.util.logging.Logger| getAnonymousLogger()

Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no access checks on updates to the logger. 

This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets. Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private by the creating class. This removes the need for 
normal security checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do a setLevel or an addHandler on an 
anonymous Logger. 

Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that by default it inherits its effective level and handlers 
from the root logger. 



    Returns: a newly created private Logger 

*java.util.logging.Logger.getAnonymousLogger(String)*

public static synchronized |java.util.logging.Logger| getAnonymousLogger(java.lang.String resourceBundleName)

Create an anonymous Logger. The newly created Logger is not registered in the LogManager namespace. There will be no access checks on updates to the logger. 

This factory method is primarily intended for use from applets. Because the resulting Logger is anonymous it can be kept private by the creating class. This removes the need for 
normal security checks, which in turn allows untrusted applet code to update the control state of the Logger. For example an applet can do a setLevel or an addHandler on an 
anonymous Logger. 

Even although the new logger is anonymous, it is configured to have the root logger ("") as its parent. This means that by default it inherits its effective level and handlers 
from the root logger.

If a new logger is created its log level will be configured based on the LogManager and it will configured to also send logging output to its parent loggers Handlers. It will be 
registered in the LogManager global namespace. 

If the named Logger already exists and does not yet have a localization resource bundle then the given resource bundle name is used. If the named Logger already exists and has a 
different resource bundle name then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. 


    name - A name for the logger. This should be a dot-separated name and should normally be based on the package name or class name of the subsystem, such as java.net or javax.swing 
    resourceBundleName - name of ResourceBundle to be used for localizing messages for this logger. May be null if none of the messages require localization.

The msg string is localized using the named resource bundle. If the resource bundle name is null, or an empty String or invalid then the msg string is not localized. 


    level - One of the message level identifiers, e.g. SEVERE 
    sourceClass - name of class that issued the logging request 
    sourceMethod - name of method that issued the logging request 
    bundleName - name of resource bundle to localize msg, can be null 
    msg - The string message (or a key in the message catalog) 
    param1 - Parameter to the log message. 

*java.util.logging.Logger.logrb(Level,String,String,String,String,Object[])*

public void logrb(
  java.util.logging.Level level,
  java.lang.String sourceClass,
  java.lang.String sourceMethod,
  java.lang.String bundleName,
  java.lang.String msg,
  java.lang.Object[] params)

Log a message, specifying source class, method, and resource bundle name, with an array of object arguments. 

If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then a corresponding LogRecord is created and forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects. 

The msg string is localized using the named resource bundle. If the resource bundle name is null, or an empty String or invalid then the msg string is not localized. 


    level - One of the message level identifiers, e.g. SEVERE 
    sourceClass - name of class that issued the logging request 
    sourceMethod - name of method that issued the logging request 
    bundleName - name of resource bundle to localize msg, can be null. 
    msg - The string message (or a key in the message catalog) 
    params - Array of parameters to the message 

*java.util.logging.Logger.logrb(Level,String,String,String,String,Throwable)*

public void logrb(
  java.util.logging.Level level,
  java.lang.String sourceClass,
  java.lang.String sourceMethod,
  java.lang.String bundleName,
  java.lang.String msg,
  java.lang.Throwable thrown)

Log a message, specifying source class, method, and resource bundle name, with associated Throwable information. 

If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord which is forwarded to all registered output handlers. 

The msg string is localized using the named resource bundle. If the resource bundle name is null, or an empty String or invalid then the msg string is not localized. 

Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown property, rather than the LogRecord parameters property. Thus is it processed specially by output Formatters and is 
not treated as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property. 


    level - One of the message level identifiers, e.g. SEVERE 
    sourceClass - name of class that issued the logging request 
    sourceMethod - name of method that issued the logging request 
    bundleName - name of resource bundle to localize msg, can be null 
    msg - The string message (or a key in the message catalog) 
    thrown - Throwable associated with log message. 

*java.util.logging.Logger.removeHandler(Handler)*

public synchronized void removeHandler(java.util.logging.Handler handler)
  throws |java.lang.SecurityException|
         
Remove a log Handler. 

Returns silently if the given Handler is not found or is null 


    handler - a logging Handler 

*java.util.logging.Logger.setFilter(Filter)*

public void setFilter(java.util.logging.Filter newFilter)
  throws |java.lang.SecurityException|
         
Set a filter to control output on this Logger. 

After passing the initial "level" check, the Logger will call this Filter to check if a log record should really be published. 


    newFilter - a filter object (may be null) 

*java.util.logging.Logger.setLevel(Level)*

public void setLevel(java.util.logging.Level newLevel)
  throws |java.lang.SecurityException|
         
Set the log level specifying which message levels will be logged by this logger. Message levels lower than this value will be discarded. The level value Level.OFF can be used to 
turn off logging. 

If the new level is null, it means that this node should inherit its level from its nearest ancestor with a specific (non-null) level value. 


    newLevel - the new value for the log level (may be null) 

*java.util.logging.Logger.setParent(Logger)*

public void setParent(java.util.logging.Logger parent)

Set the parent for this Logger. This method is used by the LogManager to update a Logger when the namespace changes. 

It should not be called from application code. 


    parent - the new parent logger 

*java.util.logging.Logger.setUseParentHandlers(boolean)*

public synchronized void setUseParentHandlers(boolean useParentHandlers)

Specify whether or not this logger should send its output to it's parent Logger. This means that any LogRecords will also be written to the parent's Handlers, and potentially to 
its parent, recursively up the namespace. 


    useParentHandlers - true if output is to be sent to the logger's parent. 

*java.util.logging.Logger.severe(String)*

public void severe(java.lang.String msg)

Log a SEVERE message. 

If the logger is currently enabled for the SEVERE message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects. 


    msg - The string message (or a key in the message catalog) 

*java.util.logging.Logger.throwing(String,String,Throwable)*

public void throwing(
  java.lang.String sourceClass,
  java.lang.String sourceMethod,
  java.lang.Throwable thrown)

Log throwing an exception. 

This is a convenience method to log that a method is terminating by throwing an exception. The logging is done using the FINER level. 

If the logger is currently enabled for the given message level then the given arguments are stored in a LogRecord which is forwarded to all registered output handlers. The 
LogRecord's message is set to "THROW". 

Note that the thrown argument is stored in the LogRecord thrown property, rather than the LogRecord parameters property. Thus is it processed specially by output Formatters and is 
not treated as a formatting parameter to the LogRecord message property. 


    sourceClass - name of class that issued the logging request 
    sourceMethod - name of the method. 
    thrown - The Throwable that is being thrown. 

*java.util.logging.Logger.warning(String)*

public void warning(java.lang.String msg)

Log a WARNING message. 

If the logger is currently enabled for the WARNING message level then the given message is forwarded to all the registered output Handler objects. 


    msg - The string message (or a key in the message catalog)
