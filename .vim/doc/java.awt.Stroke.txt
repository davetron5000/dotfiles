*java.awt.Stroke_Description*

The Stroke interface allows a (|java.awt.Graphics2D|) object to obtain a 
(|java.awt.Shape|) that is the decorated outline, or stylistic representation 
of the outline, of the specified Shape. Stroking a Shape is like tracing its 
outline with a marking pen of the appropriate size and shape. The area where 
the pen would place ink is the area enclosed by the outline Shape. 

The methods of the Graphics2D interface that use the outline Shape returned by 
a Stroke object include draw and any other methods that are implemented in 
terms of that method, such as drawLine, drawRect, drawRoundRect, drawOval, 
drawArc, drawPolyline, and drawPolygon. 

The objects of the classes implementing Stroke must be read-only because 
Graphics2D does not clone these objects either when they are set as an 
attribute with the setStroke method or when the Graphics2D object is itself 
cloned. If a Stroke object is modified after it is set in the Graphics2D 
context then the behavior of subsequent rendering would be undefined. 


*java.awt.Stroke.createStrokedShape(Shape)*

public |java.awt.Shape| createStrokedShape(java.awt.Shape p)

Returns an outline Shape which encloses the area that should be painted when 
the Shape is stroked according to the rules defined by the object implementing 
the Stroke interface. 

    p - a Shape to be stroked 

    Returns: the stroked outline Shape.
