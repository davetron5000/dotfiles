*javax.xml.transform.Source_Description*

An object that implements this interface contains the information needed to act 
as source input (XML source or transformation instructions). 


*javax.xml.transform.Source.getSystemId()*

public |java.lang.String| getSystemId()

Get the system identifier that was set with setSystemId. 


    Returns: The system identifier that was set with setSystemId, or null if setSystemId was 
             not called. 
*javax.xml.transform.Source.setSystemId(String)*

public void setSystemId(java.lang.String systemId)

Set the system identifier for this Source. 

The system identifier is optional if the source does not get its data from a 
URL, but it may still be useful to provide one. The application can use a 
system identifier, for example, to resolve relative URIs and to include in 
error messages and warnings. 

    systemId - The system identifier as a URL string.
