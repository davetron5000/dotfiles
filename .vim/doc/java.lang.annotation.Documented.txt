*java.lang.annotation.Documented_Description*

Indicates that annotations with a type are to be documented by javadoc and 
similar tools by default. This type should be used to annotate the declarations 
of types whose annotations affect the use of annotated elements by their 
clients. If a type declaration is annotated with Documented, its annotations 
become part of the public API of the annotated elements.
