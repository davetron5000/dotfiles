*java.awt.geom.Point2D_Description*

The Point2D class defines a point representing a location in (x,y) coordinate space. 

This class is only the abstract superclass for all objects that store a 2D coordinate. The actual storage representation of the coordinates is left to the subclass. 



*java.awt.geom.Point2D()*

protected Point2D()

This is an abstract class that cannot be instantiated directly. Type-specific implementation subclasses are available for instantiation and provide a number of formats for storing 
the information necessary to satisfy the various accessor methods below. 


*java.awt.geom.Point2D.clone()*

public |java.lang.Object| clone()

Creates a new object of the same class and with the same contents as this object. 



    Returns: a clone of this instance. 

*java.awt.geom.Point2D.distance(double,double)*

public double distance(
  double PX,
  double PY)

Returns the distance from this Point2D to a specified point. 


    PX,&nbsp;PY - the coordinates of the specified Point2D 

    Returns: the distance between this Point2D and a specified point. 

*java.awt.geom.Point2D.distance(double,double,double,double)*

public static double distance(
  double X1,
  double Y1,
  double X2,
  double Y2)

Returns the distance between two points. 


    X1,&nbsp;Y1 - the coordinates of the first point 
    X2,&nbsp;Y2 - the coordinates of the second point 

    Returns: the distance between the two sets of specified coordinates. 

*java.awt.geom.Point2D.distance(Point2D)*

public double distance(java.awt.geom.Point2D pt)

Returns the distance from this Point2D to a specified Point2D. 


    pt - the specified Point2D 

    Returns: the distance between this Point2D and the specified Point2D. 

*java.awt.geom.Point2D.distanceSq(double,double)*

public double distanceSq(
  double PX,
  double PY)

Returns the square of the distance from this Point2D to a specified point. 


    PX,&nbsp;PY - the coordinates of the other point 

    Returns: the square of the distance between this Point2D and the specified point.

public static double distanceSq(
  double X1,
  double Y1,
  double X2,
  double Y2)

Returns the square of the distance between two points. 


    X1,&nbsp;Y1 - the coordinates of the first point
