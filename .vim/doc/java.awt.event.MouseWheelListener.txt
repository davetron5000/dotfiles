*java.awt.event.MouseWheelListener_Description*

The listener interface for receiving mouse wheel events on a component. (For 
clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseListener. For mouse movement and 
drags, use the MouseMotionListener.) 

The class that is interested in processing a mouse wheel event implements this 
interface (and all the methods it contains). 

The listener object created from that class is then registered with a component 
using the component's addMouseWheelListener method. A mouse wheel event is 
generated when the mouse wheel is rotated. When a mouse wheel event occurs, 
that object's mouseWheelMoved method is invoked. 

For information on how mouse wheel events are dispatched, see the class 
description for (|java.awt.event.MouseWheelEvent|) .
