*java.awt.dnd.DragSourceMotionListener_Description*

A listener interface for receiving mouse motion events during a drag operation. 

The class that is interested in processing mouse motion events during a drag operation either implements this interface or extends the abstract DragSourceAdapter class (overriding 
only the methods of interest). 

Create a listener object using that class and then register it with a DragSource. Whenever the mouse moves during a drag operation initiated with this DragSource, that object's 
dragMouseMoved method is invoked, and the DragSourceDragEvent is passed to it. 



*java.awt.dnd.DragSourceMotionListener.dragMouseMoved(DragSourceDragEvent)*

public void dragMouseMoved(java.awt.dnd.DragSourceDragEvent dsde)

Called whenever the mouse is moved during a drag operation. 


    dsde - the DragSourceDragEvent
