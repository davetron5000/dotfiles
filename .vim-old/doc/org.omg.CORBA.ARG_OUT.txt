*org.omg.CORBA.ARG_OUT_Description*

A constant that signifies an "output" argument to an invocation, meaning that 
the argument is being passed from the server to the client. ARG_OUT.value is 
one of the possible values used to indicate the direction in which a parameter 
is being passed during a dynamic invocation using the Dynamic Invocation 
Interface (DII). 

The code fragment below shows a typical usage: 

ORB orb = ORB.init(args, null); org.omg.CORBA.NamedValue nv = 
orb.create_named_value( "argumentIdentifier", myAny, 
org.omg.CORBA.ARG_OUT.value);
