*java.awt.image.TileObserver_Description*

An interface for objects that wish to be informed when tiles of a WritableRenderedImage become modifiable by some writer via a call to getWritableTile, and when they become 
unmodifiable via the last call to releaseWritableTile. 



*java.awt.image.TileObserver.tileUpdate(WritableRenderedImage,int,int,boolean)*

public void tileUpdate(
  java.awt.image.WritableRenderedImage source,
  int tileX,
  int tileY,
  boolean willBeWritable)

A tile is about to be updated (it is either about to be grabbed for writing, or it is being released from writing). 


    source - the image that owns the tile. 
    tileX - the X index of the tile that is being updated. 
    tileY - the Y index of the tile that is being updated. 
    willBeWritable - If true, the tile will be grabbed for writing; otherwise it is being released.
