*javax.management.PersistentMBean_Description*

This class is the interface to be implemented by MBeans that are meant to be 
persistent. MBeans supporting this interface should call the load method during 
construction in order to prime the MBean from the persistent store. In the case 
of a ModelMBean, the store method should be called by the MBeanServer based on 
the descriptors in the ModelMBean or by the MBean itself during normal 
processing of the ModelMBean. 


*javax.management.PersistentMBean.load()*

public void load()
  throws |javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException|
         |javax.management.MBeanException|
         |javax.management.RuntimeOperationsException|
         
Instantiates thisMBean instance with the data found for the MBean in the 
persistent store. The data loaded could include attribute and operation values. 

This method should be called during construction or initialization of this 
instance, and before the MBean is registered with the MBeanServer. 


*javax.management.PersistentMBean.store()*

public void store()
  throws |javax.management.InstanceNotFoundException|
         |javax.management.MBeanException|
         |javax.management.RuntimeOperationsException|
         
Captures the current state of this MBean instance and writes it out to the 
persistent store. The state stored could include attribute and operation 
values. If one of these methods of persistence is not supported a 
"serviceNotFound" exception will be thrown. 

Persistence policy from the MBean and attribute descriptor is used to guide 
execution of this method. The MBean should be stored if 'persistPolicy' field 
is: 

!= "never" = "always" = "onTimer" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod' 
= "NoMoreOftenThan" and now > 'lastPersistTime' + 'persistPeriod' 

Do not store the MBean if 'persistPolicy' field is: = "never" = "onUpdate" = 
"onTimer" now
