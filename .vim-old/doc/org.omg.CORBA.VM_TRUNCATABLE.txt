*org.omg.CORBA.VM_TRUNCATABLE_Description*

Defines the code used to represent a truncatable value type in a typecode. A 
value type is truncatable if it inherits "safely" from another value type, 
which means it can be cast to a more general inherited type. This is one of the 
possible results of the type_modifier method on the TypeCode interface.
