*org.xml.sax.XMLFilter_Description*

Interface for an XML filter. 

This module, both source code and documentation, is in the Public Domain, and 
comes with NO WARRANTY. See http://www.saxproject.org for further information. 

An XML filter is like an XML reader, except that it obtains its events from 
another XML reader rather than a primary source like an XML document or 
database. Filters can modify a stream of events as they pass on to the final 
application. 

The XMLFilterImpl helper class provides a convenient base for creating SAX2 
filters, by passing on all EntityResolver(|org.xml.sax.EntityResolver|) , 
DTDHandler(|org.xml.sax.DTDHandler|) , 
ContentHandler(|org.xml.sax.ContentHandler|) and 
ErrorHandler(|org.xml.sax.ErrorHandler|) events automatically. 


*org.xml.sax.XMLFilter.getParent()*

public |org.xml.sax.XMLReader| getParent()

Get the parent reader. 

This method allows the application to query the parent reader (which may be 
another filter). It is generally a bad idea to perform any operations on the 
parent reader directly: they should all pass through this filter. 


    Returns: The parent filter, or null if none has been set. 
*org.xml.sax.XMLFilter.setParent(XMLReader)*

public void setParent(org.xml.sax.XMLReader parent)

Set the parent reader. 

This method allows the application to link the filter to a parent reader (which 
may be another filter). The argument may not be null. 

    parent - The parent reader.
