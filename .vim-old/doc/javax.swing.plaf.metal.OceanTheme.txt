*javax.swing.plaf.metal.OceanTheme_Description*

This class provides an updated look for applications using MetalLookAndFeel. The designers of the Metal Look and Feel strive to keep the default look up to date, possibly through 
the use of new themes in the future. Therefore, developers should only use this class directly when they wish to customize the "Ocean" look, or force it to be the current theme, 
regardless of future updates.
