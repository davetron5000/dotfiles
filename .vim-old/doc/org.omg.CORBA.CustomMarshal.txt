*org.omg.CORBA.CustomMarshal_Description*

An abstract value type that is meant to be used by the ORB, not the user. 
Semantically it is treated as a custom value type's implicit base class, 
although the custom valuetype does not actually inherit it in IDL. The 
implementer of a custom value type shall provide an implementation of the 
CustomMarshal operations. The manner in which this is done is specified in the 
IDL to Java langauge mapping. Each custom marshaled value type shall have its 
own implementation. 


*org.omg.CORBA.CustomMarshal.marshal(DataOutputStream)*

public void marshal(org.omg.CORBA.DataOutputStream os)

Marshal method has to be implemented by the Customized Marshal class. This is 
the method invoked for Marshalling. 

    os - a DataOutputStream 

*org.omg.CORBA.CustomMarshal.unmarshal(DataInputStream)*

public void unmarshal(org.omg.CORBA.DataInputStream is)

Unmarshal method has to be implemented by the Customized Marshal class. This is 
the method invoked for Unmarshalling. 

    is - a DataInputStream
