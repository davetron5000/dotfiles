*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons_Description*

Class JobStateReasons is a printing attribute class, a set of enumeration values, that provides additional information about the job's current state, i.e., information that 
augments the value of the job's JobState(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobState|) attribute. 

Instances of JobStateReason(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason|) do not appear in a Print Job's attribute set directly. Rather, a JobStateReasons attribute appears in 
the Print Job's attribute set. The JobStateReasons attribute contains zero, one, or more than one JobStateReason(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason|) objects which 
pertain to the Print Job's status. The printer adds a JobStateReason(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason|) object to the Print Job's JobStateReasons attribute when the 
corresponding condition becomes true of the Print Job, and the printer removes the JobStateReason(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason|) object again when the 
corresponding condition becomes false, regardless of whether the Print Job's overall JobState(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobState|) also changed. 

Class JobStateReasons inherits its implementation from class java.util.HashSet(|java.util.HashSet|) . Unlike most printing attributes which are immutable once constructed, class 
JobStateReasons is designed to be mutable; you can add JobStateReason(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason|) objects to an existing JobStateReasons object and remove 
them again. However, like class java.util.HashSet(|java.util.HashSet|) , class JobStateReasons is not multiple thread safe. If a JobStateReasons object will be used by multiple 
threads, be sure to synchronize its operations (e.g., using a synchronized set view obtained from class java.util.Collections(|java.util.Collections|) ). 

IPP Compatibility: The string value returned by each individual JobStateReason(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason|) object's toString() method gives the IPP keyword 
value. The category name returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name. 



*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons()*

public JobStateReasons()

Construct a new, empty job state reasons attribute; the underlying hash set has the default initial capacity and load factor. 


*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons(Collection<JobStateReason>)*

public JobStateReasons(java.util.Collection<javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason> collection)

Construct a new job state reasons attribute that contains the same JobStateReason(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason|) objects as the given collection. The underlying 
hash set's initial capacity and load factor are as specified in the superclass constructor <CODE>HashSet(Collection)</CODE>(|java.util.HashSet|) . 

    collection - Collection to copy. 

*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons(int)*

public JobStateReasons(int initialCapacity)

Construct a new, empty job state reasons attribute; the underlying hash set has the given initial capacity and the default load factor. 

    initialCapacity - Initial capacity. 

*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons(int,float)*

public JobStateReasons(
  int initialCapacity,
  float loadFactor)

Construct a new, empty job state reasons attribute; the underlying hash set has the given initial capacity and load factor. 

    initialCapacity - Initial capacity. 
    loadFactor - Load factor. 

*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons.add(JobStateReason)*

public boolean add(javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason o)

Adds the specified element to this job state reasons attribute if it is not already present. The element to be added must be an instance of class 
JobStateReason(|javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReason|) . If this job state reasons attribute already contains the specified element, the call leaves this job state 
reasons attribute unchanged and returns false. 


    o - Element to be added to this job state reasons attribute. 

    Returns: true if this job state reasons attribute did not already contain the specified element. 

*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons.getCategory()*

public final |java.lang.Class|<? extends javax.print.attribute.Attribute> getCategory()

Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" for this printing attribute value. 

For class JobStateReasons, the category is class JobStateReasons itself. 



    Returns: Printing attribute class (category), an instance of class {@link java.lang.Class java.lang.Class}. 

*javax.print.attribute.standard.JobStateReasons.getName()*

public final |java.lang.String| getName()

Get the name of the category of which this attribute value is an instance. 

For class JobStateReasons, the category name is "job-state-reasons". 



    Returns: Attribute category name.
