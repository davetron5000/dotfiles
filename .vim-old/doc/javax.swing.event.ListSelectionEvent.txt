*javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent_Description*

An event that characterizes a change in the current selection. The change is limited to a row interval. ListSelectionListeners will generally query the source of the event for the 
new selected status of each potentially changed row. 

Warning: Serialized objects of this class will not be compatible with future Swing releases. The current serialization support is appropriate for short term storage or RMI between 
applications running the same version of Swing. As of 1.4, support for long term storage of all JavaBeansTM has been added to the java.beans package. Please see 
(|java.beans.XMLEncoder|) . 



*javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent(Object,int,int,boolean)*

public ListSelectionEvent(
  java.lang.Object source,
  int firstIndex,
  int lastIndex,
  boolean isAdjusting)

Represents a change in selection status between firstIndex and lastIndex inclusive (firstIndex is less than or equal to lastIndex). At least one of the rows within the range will 
have changed, a good ListSelectionModel implementation will keep the range as small as possible. 

    firstIndex - the first index that changed 
    lastIndex - the last index that changed, lastIndex >= firstIndex 
    isAdjusting - an indication that this is one of rapid a series of events 

*javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent.getFirstIndex()*

public int getFirstIndex()

Returns the index of the first row whose selection may have changed. 



    Returns: the first row whose selection value may have changed, where zero is the first row 

*javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent.getLastIndex()*

public int getLastIndex()

Returns the index of the last row whose selection may have changed. 



    Returns: the last row whose selection value may have changed, where zero is the first row 

*javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent.getValueIsAdjusting()*

public boolean getValueIsAdjusting()

Returns true if this is one of multiple change events. 



    Returns: true if this is one of a rapid series of events 

*javax.swing.event.ListSelectionEvent.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Returns a string that displays and identifies this object's properties. 



    Returns: a String representation of this object
