*java.util.Collections_Description*

This class consists exclusively of static methods that operate on or return collections. It contains polymorphic algorithms that operate on collections, "wrappers", which return a 
new collection backed by a specified collection, and a few other odds and ends. 

The methods of this class all throw a NullPointerException if the collections or class objects provided to them are null. 

The documentation for the polymorphic algorithms contained in this class generally includes a brief description of the implementation. Such descriptions should be regarded as 
implementation notes, rather than parts of the specification. Implementors should feel free to substitute other algorithms, so long as the specification itself is adhered to. (For 
example, the algorithm used by sort does not have to be a mergesort, but it does have to be stable.) 

The "destructive" algorithms contained in this class, that is, the algorithms that modify the collection on which they operate, are specified to throw 
UnsupportedOperationException if the collection does not support the appropriate mutation primitive(s), such as the set method. These algorithms may, but are not required to, 
throw this exception if an invocation would have no effect on the collection. For example, invoking the sort method on an unmodifiable list that is already sorted may or may not 
throw UnsupportedOperationException. 

This class is a member of the <a href="/../guide/collections/index.html"> Java Collections Framework. 



*java.util.List_java.util.Collections.EMPTY_LIST*

The empty list (immutable). This list is serializable. 


*java.util.Map_java.util.Collections.EMPTY_MAP*

The empty map (immutable). This map is serializable. 


*java.util.Set_java.util.Collections.EMPTY_SET*

The empty set (immutable). This set is serializable. 



*java.util.Collections.addAll(Collection<?superT>,T...)*

public static boolean addAll(
  java.util.Collection<? super T> c,
  T[] a)

Adds all of the specified elements to the specified collection. Elements to be added may be specified individually or as an array. The behavior of this convenience method is 
identical to that of c.addAll(Arrays.asList(elements)), but this method is likely to run significantly faster under most implementations. 

When elements are specified individually, this method provides a convenient way to add a few elements to an existing collection: 

Collections.addAll(flavors, "Peaches 'n Plutonium", "Rocky Racoon"); 


    c - the collection into which elements are to be inserted 
    a - the elements to insert into c 

    Returns: true if the collection changed as a result of the call 

*java.util.Collections.binarySearch(List<?extendsComparable<?superT>>,T)*

public static int binarySearch(
  java.util.List<? extends java.lang.Comparable<? super T>> list,
  T key)

Searches the specified list for the specified object using the binary search algorithm. The list must be sorted into ascending order according to the natural ordering of its 
elements (as by the sort(List) method, above) prior to making this call. If it is not sorted, the results are undefined. If the list contains multiple elements equal to the 
specified object, there is no guarantee which one will be found. 

This method runs in log(n) time for a "random access" list (which provides near-constant-time positional access). If the specified list does not implement the 
(|java.util.RandomAccess|) interface and is large, this method will do an iterator-based binary search that performs O(n) link traversals and O(log n) element comparisons. 


    list - the list to be searched. 
    key - the key to be searched for. 

    Returns: index of the search key, if it is contained in the list; otherwise, (-(insertion point) - 1). The insertion point is defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into 
             the list: the index of the first element greater than the key, or list.size(), if all elements in the list are less than the specified key. Note that this guarantees 
             that the return value will be >= 0 if and only if the key is found. 

*java.util.Collections.binarySearch(List<?extendsT>,T,Comparator<?superT>)*

public static int binarySearch(
  java.util.List<? extends T> list,
  T key,
  java.util.Comparator<? super T> c)

Searches the specified list for the specified object using the binary search algorithm. The list must be sorted into ascending order according to the specified comparator (as by 
the Sort(List, Comparator) method, above), prior to making this call. If it is not sorted, the results are undefined. If the list contains multiple elements equal to the specified 
object, there is no guarantee which one will be found. 

This method runs in log(n) time for a "random access" list (which provides near-constant-time positional access). If the specified list does not implement the 
(|java.util.RandomAccess|) interface and is large, this method will do an iterator-based binary search that performs O(n) link traversals and O(log n) element comparisons. 


    list - the list to be searched. 
    key - the key to be searched for. 
    c - the comparator by which the list is ordered. A null value indicates that the elements' natural ordering should be used. 

    Returns: index of the search key, if it is contained in the list; otherwise, (-(insertion point) - 1). The insertion point is defined as the point at which the key would be inserted into 
             the list: the index of the first element greater than the key, or list.size(), if all elements in the list are less than the specified key. Note that this guarantees 
             that the return value will be >= 0 if and only if the key is found. 

*java.util.Collections.checkedCollection(Collection<E>,Class<E>)*

public static |java.util.Collection|<E> checkedCollection(
  java.util.Collection<E> c,
  java.lang.Class<E> type)

Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified collection. Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an immediate ClassCastException. Assuming a 
collection contains no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the collection takes place through 
the view, it is guaranteed that the collection cannot contain an incorrectly typed element. 

The generics mechanism in the language provides compile-time (static) type checking, but it is possible to defeat this mechanism with unchecked casts. Usually this is not a 
problem, as the compiler issues warnings on all such unchecked operations. There are, however, times when static type checking alone is not sufficient. For example, suppose a 
collection is passed to a third-party library and it is imperative that the library code not corrupt the collection by inserting an element of the wrong type. 

Another use of dynamically typesafe views is debugging. Suppose a program fails with a ClassCastException, indicating that an incorrectly typed element was put into a 
parameterized collection. Unfortunately, the exception can occur at any time after the erroneous element is inserted, so it typically provides little or no information as to the 
real source of the problem. If the problem is reproducible, one can quickly determine its source by temporarily modifying the program to wrap the collection with a dynamically 
typesafe view. For example, this declaration: 

Collection<String> c = new HashSet<String>(); 

may be replaced temporarily by this one: 

Collection<String> c = Collections.checkedCollection( new HashSet<String>(), String.class); 

Running the program again will cause it to fail at the point where an incorrectly typed element is inserted into the collection, clearly identifying the source of the problem. 
Once the problem is fixed, the modified declaration may be reverted back to the original. 

The returned collection does not pass the hashCode and equals operations through to the backing collection, but relies on Object's equals and hashCode methods. This is necessary 
to preserve the contracts of these operations in the case that the backing collection is a set or a list. 

The returned collection will be serializable if the specified collection is serializable. 


    c - the collection for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be returned 
    type - the type of element that c is permitted to hold 

    Returns: a dynamically typesafe view of the specified collection 

*java.util.Collections.checkedList(List<E>,Class<E>)*

public static |java.util.List|<E> checkedList(
  java.util.List<E> list,
  java.lang.Class<E> type)

Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified list. Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an immediate ClassCastException. Assuming a list 
contains no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the list takes place through the view, it is 
guaranteed that the list cannot contain an incorrectly typed element. 

A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be found in the documentation for the checkedCollection(|java.util.Collections|) method. 

The returned list will be serializable if the specified list is serializable. 


    list - the list for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be returned 
    type - the type of element that list is permitted to hold 

    Returns: a dynamically typesafe view of the specified list 

*java.util.Collections.checkedMap(Map<K,V>,Class<K>,Class<V>)*

public static |java.util.Map|<K,V> checkedMap(
  java.util.Map<K, V> m,
  java.lang.Class<K> keyType,
  java.lang.Class<V> valueType)

Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified map. Any attempt to insert a mapping whose key or value have the wrong type will result in an immediate ClassCastException. 
Similarly, any attempt to modify the value currently associated with a key will result in an immediate ClassCastException, whether the modification is attempted directly through 
the map itself, or through a (|java.util.Map.Entry|) instance obtained from the map's entry set(|java.util.Map|) view. 

Assuming a map contains no incorrectly typed keys or values prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the map takes place 
through the view (or one of its collection views), it is guaranteed that the map cannot contain an incorrectly typed key or value. 

A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be found in the documentation for the checkedCollection(|java.util.Collections|) method. 

The returned map will be serializable if the specified map is serializable. 


    m - the map for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be returned 
    keyType - the type of key that m is permitted to hold 
    valueType - the type of value that m is permitted to hold 

    Returns: a dynamically typesafe view of the specified map 

*java.util.Collections.checkedSet(Set<E>,Class<E>)*

public static |java.util.Set|<E> checkedSet(
  java.util.Set<E> s,
  java.lang.Class<E> type)

Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified set. Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an immediate ClassCastException. Assuming a set 
contains no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the set takes place through the view, it is 
guaranteed that the set cannot contain an incorrectly typed element. 

A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be found in the documentation for the checkedCollection(|java.util.Collections|) method. 

The returned set will be serializable if the specified set is serializable. 


    s - the set for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be returned 
    type - the type of element that s is permitted to hold 

    Returns: a dynamically typesafe view of the specified set 

*java.util.Collections.checkedSortedMap(SortedMap<K,V>,Class<K>,Class<V>)*

public static |java.util.SortedMap|<K,V> checkedSortedMap(
  java.util.SortedMap<K, V> m,
  java.lang.Class<K> keyType,
  java.lang.Class<V> valueType)

Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified sorted map. Any attempt to insert a mapping whose key or value have the wrong type will result in an immediate 
ClassCastException. Similarly, any attempt to modify the value currently associated with a key will result in an immediate ClassCastException, whether the modification is 
attempted directly through the map itself, or through a (|java.util.Map.Entry|) instance obtained from the map's entry set(|java.util.Map|) view. 

Assuming a map contains no incorrectly typed keys or values prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the map takes place 
through the view (or one of its collection views), it is guaranteed that the map cannot contain an incorrectly typed key or value. 

A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be found in the documentation for the checkedCollection(|java.util.Collections|) method. 

The returned map will be serializable if the specified map is serializable. 


    m - the map for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be returned 
    keyType - the type of key that m is permitted to hold 
    valueType - the type of value that m is permitted to hold 

    Returns: a dynamically typesafe view of the specified map 

*java.util.Collections.checkedSortedSet(SortedSet<E>,Class<E>)*

public static |java.util.SortedSet|<E> checkedSortedSet(
  java.util.SortedSet<E> s,
  java.lang.Class<E> type)

Returns a dynamically typesafe view of the specified sorted set. Any attempt to insert an element of the wrong type will result in an immediate ClassCastException. Assuming a 
sorted set contains no incorrectly typed elements prior to the time a dynamically typesafe view is generated, and that all subsequent access to the sorted set takes place through 
the view, it is guaranteed that the sorted set cannot contain an incorrectly typed element. 

A discussion of the use of dynamically typesafe views may be found in the documentation for the checkedCollection(|java.util.Collections|) method. 

The returned sorted set will be serializable if the specified sorted set is serializable. 


    s - the sorted set for which a dynamically typesafe view is to be returned 
    type - the type of element that s is permitted to hold 

    Returns: a dynamically typesafe view of the specified sorted set 

*java.util.Collections.copy(List<?superT>,List<?extendsT>)*

public static void copy(
  java.util.List<? super T> dest,
  java.util.List<? extends T> src)

Copies all of the elements from one list into another. After the operation, the index of each copied element in the destination list will be identical to its index in the source 
list. The destination list must be at least as long as the source list. If it is longer, the remaining elements in the destination list are unaffected. 

This method runs in linear time. 


    dest - The destination list. 
    src - The source list. 

*java.util.Collections.disjoint(Collection<?>,Collection<?>)*

public static boolean disjoint(
  java.util.Collection<?> c1,
  java.util.Collection<?> c2)

Returns true if the two specified collections have no elements in common. 

Care must be exercised if this method is used on collections that do not comply with the general contract for Collection. Implementations may elect to iterate over either 
collection and test for containment in the other collection (or to perform any equivalent computation). If either collection uses a nonstandard equality test (as does a 
(|java.util.SortedSet|) whose ordering is not compatible with equals, or the key set of an (|java.util.IdentityHashMap|) ), both collections must use the same nonstandard equality 
test, or the result of this method is undefined. 

Note that it is permissible to pass the same collection in both parameters, in which case the method will return true if and only if the collection is empty. 


    c1 - a collection 
    c2 - a collection 

*java.util.Collections.emptyList()*

public static final |java.util.List|<T> emptyList()

Returns the empty list (immutable). This list is serializable. 

This example illustrates the type-safe way to obtain an empty list: 

List<String> s = Collections.emptyList(); 

Implementation note: Implementations of this method need not create a separate List object for each call. Using this method is likely to have comparable cost to using the 
like-named field. (Unlike this method, the field does not provide type safety.) 



*java.util.Collections.emptyMap()*

public static final |java.util.Map|<K,V> emptyMap()

Returns the empty map (immutable). This map is serializable. 

This example illustrates the type-safe way to obtain an empty set: 

Map<String, Date> s = Collections.emptyMap(); 

Implementation note: Implementations of this method need not create a separate Map object for each call. Using this method is likely to have comparable cost to using the 
like-named field. (Unlike this method, the field does not provide type safety.) 



*java.util.Collections.emptySet()*

Implementation note: Implementations of this method need not create a separate Set object for each call. Using this method is likely to have comparable cost to using the 
like-named field. (Unlike this method, the field does not provide type safety.) 



*java.util.Collections.enumeration(Collection<T>)*

the lowest index i such that source.subList(i, i+target.size()).equals(target), or -1 if there is no such index. (Returns -1 if target.size() > source.size().) 

This implementation uses the "brute force" technique of scanning over the source list, looking for a match with the target at each location in turn. 


    source - the list in which to search for the first occurrence of target. 
    target - the list to search for as a subList of source. 

    Returns: the starting position of the first occurrence of the specified target list within the specified source list, or -1 if there is no such occurrence. 

*java.util.Collections.lastIndexOfSubList(List<?>,List<?>)*

public static int lastIndexOfSubList(
  java.util.List<?> source,

    Returns: an array list containing the elements returned by the specified enumeration. 

*java.util.Collections.max(Collection<?extendsT>)*

public static |T| max(java.util.Collection<? extends T> coll)

Returns the maximum element of the given collection, according to the natural ordering of its elements. All elements in the collection must implement the Comparable interface. 
Furthermore, all elements in the collection must be mutually comparable (that is, e1.compareTo(e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the 
collection).

specified comparator (that is, comp.compare(e1, e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the collection). 

This method iterates over the entire collection, hence it requires time proportional to the size of the collection. 


    coll - the collection whose maximum element is to be determined. 
    comp - the comparator with which to determine the maximum element. A null value indicates that the elements' natural ordering should be used. 

    Returns: the maximum element of the given collection, according to the specified comparator.

Furthermore, all elements in the collection must be mutually comparable (that is, e1.compareTo(e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the

This method iterates over the entire collection, hence it requires time proportional to the size of the collection.

specified comparator (that is, comp.compare(e1, e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the collection). 

This method iterates over the entire collection, hence it requires time proportional to the size of the collection. 


    coll - the collection whose minimum element is to be determined.

public static |java.util.List|<T> nCopies(
  int n,
  T o)

    o - the element to appear repeatedly in the returned list. 

    Returns: an immutable list consisting of n copies of the specified object.

  java.util.List<T> list,
  T oldVal,
  T newVal)

Replaces all occurrences of one specified value in a list with another. More formally, replaces with newVal each element e in list such that (oldVal==null ? e==null : 
oldVal.equals(e)). (This method has no effect on the size of the list.) 


    list - the list in which replacement is to occur. 
    oldVal - the old value to be replaced. 
    newVal - the new value with which oldVal is to be replaced. 

    Returns: true if list contained one or more elements e such that (oldVal==null ? e==null : oldVal.equals(e)). 

*java.util.Collections.reverse(List<?>)*

public static void reverse(java.util.List<?> list)

Reverses the order of the elements in the specified list. 

This method runs in linear time. 


    list - the list whose elements are to be reversed. 

*java.util.Collections.reverseOrder()*

public static |java.util.Comparator|<T> reverseOrder()

Returns a comparator that imposes the reverse of the natural ordering on a collection of objects that implement the Comparable interface. (The natural ordering is the ordering 
imposed by the objects' own compareTo method.) This enables a simple idiom for sorting (or maintaining) collections (or arrays) of objects that implement the Comparable interface 
in reverse-natural-order. For example, suppose a is an array of strings. Then: 

Arrays.sort(a, Collections.reverseOrder()); 

sorts the array in reverse-lexicographic (alphabetical) order. 

The returned comparator is serializable. 



    Returns: a comparator that imposes the reverse of the natural ordering on a collection of objects that implement the Comparable interface. 

*java.util.Collections.reverseOrder(Comparator<T>)*

public static |java.util.Comparator|<T> reverseOrder(java.util.Comparator<T> cmp)

Returns a comparator that imposes the reverse ordering of the specified comparator. If the specified comparator is null, this method is equivalent to (|java.util.Collections|) (in 
other words, it returns a comparator that imposes the reverse of the natural ordering on a collection of objects that implement the Comparable interface). 

The returned comparator is serializable (assuming the specified comparator is also serializable or null). 



    Returns: a comparator that imposes the reverse ordering of the specified comparator. 

*java.util.Collections.rotate(List<?>,int)*

public static void rotate(
  java.util.List<?> list,
  int distance)

Rotates the elements in the specified list by the specified distance. After calling this method, the element at index i will be the element previously at index (i - distance) mod 
list.size(), for all values of i between 0 and list.size()-1, inclusive. (This method has no effect on the size of the list.) 

For example, suppose list comprises [t, a, n, k, s]. After invoking Collections.rotate(list, 1) (or Collections.rotate(list, -4)), list will comprise [s, t, a, n, k]. 

Note that this method can usefully be applied to sublists to move one or more elements within a list while preserving the order of the remaining elements. For example, the 
following idiom moves the element at index j forward to position k (which must be greater than or equal to j): 

Collections.rotate(list.subList(j, k+1), -1); 

To make this concrete, suppose list comprises [a, b, c, d, e]. To move the element at index 1 (b) forward two positions, perform the following invocation: 

Collections.rotate(l.subList(1, 4), -1); 

The resulting list is [a, c, d, b, e]. 

To move more than one element forward, increase the absolute value of the rotation distance. To move elements backward, use a positive shift distance. 

If the specified list is small or implements the (|java.util.RandomAccess|) interface, this implementation exchanges the first element into the location it should go, and then 
repeatedly exchanges the displaced element into the location it should go until a displaced element is swapped into the first element. If necessary, the process is repeated on the 
second and successive elements, until the rotation is complete. If the specified list is large and doesn't implement the RandomAccess interface, this implementation breaks the 
list into two sublist views around index -distance mod size. Then the (|java.util.Collections|) method is invoked on each sublist view, and finally it is invoked on the entire 
list. For a more complete description of both algorithms, see Section 2.3 of Jon Bentley's Programming Pearls (Addison-Wesley, 1986). 


    list - the list to be rotated. 
    distance - the distance to rotate the list. There are no constraints on this value; it may be zero, negative, or greater than list.size(). 

*java.util.Collections.shuffle(List<?>)*

public static void shuffle(java.util.List<?> list)

Randomly permutes the specified list using a default source of randomness. All permutations occur with approximately equal likelihood. 

The hedge "approximately" is used in the foregoing description because default source of randomness is only approximately an unbiased source of independently chosen bits. If it 
were a perfect source of randomly chosen bits, then the algorithm would choose permutations with perfect uniformity. 

This implementation traverses the list backwards, from the last element up to the second, repeatedly swapping a randomly selected element into the "current position". Elements are 
randomly selected from the portion of the list that runs from the first element to the current position, inclusive. 

This method runs in linear time. If the specified list does not implement the (|java.util.RandomAccess|) interface and is large, this implementation dumps the specified list into 
an array before shuffling it, and dumps the shuffled array back into the list. This avoids the quadratic behavior that would result from shuffling a "sequential access" list in 
place. 


    list - the list to be shuffled. 

*java.util.Collections.shuffle(List<?>,Random)*

public static void shuffle(
  java.util.List<?> list,
  java.util.Random rnd)

Randomly permute the specified list using the specified source of randomness. All permutations occur with equal likelihood assuming that the source of randomness is fair. 

This implementation traverses the list backwards, from the last element up to the second, repeatedly swapping a randomly selected element into the "current position". Elements are 
randomly selected from the portion of the list that runs from the first element to the current position, inclusive. 

This method runs in linear time. If the specified list does not implement the (|java.util.RandomAccess|) interface and is large, this implementation dumps the specified list into 
an array before shuffling it, and dumps the shuffled array back into the list. This avoids the quadratic behavior that would result from shuffling a "sequential access" list in 
place. 


    list - the list to be shuffled. 
    rnd - the source of randomness to use to shuffle the list. 

*java.util.Collections.singleton(T)*

  K key,
  V value)

Returns an immutable map, mapping only the specified key to the specified value. The returned map is serializable. 


    key - the sole key to be stored in the returned map. 
    value - the value to which the returned map maps key. 

    Returns: an immutable map containing only the specified key-value mapping. 

*java.util.Collections.sort(List<T>)*

public static void sort(java.util.List<T> list)

Sorts the specified list into ascending order, according to the natural ordering of its elements. All elements in the list must implement the Comparable interface. Furthermore, 
all elements in the list must be mutually comparable (that is, e1.compareTo(e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the list). 

This sort is guaranteed to be stable: equal elements will not be reordered as a result of the sort. 

The specified list must be modifiable, but need not be resizable. 

The sorting algorithm is a modified mergesort (in which the merge is omitted if the highest element in the low sublist is less than the lowest element in the high sublist). This 
algorithm offers guaranteed n log(n) performance. 

This implementation dumps the specified list into an array, sorts the array, and iterates over the list resetting each element from the corresponding position in the array. This 
avoids the n2 log(n) performance that would result from attempting to sort a linked list in place. 


    list - the list to be sorted. 

*java.util.Collections.sort(List<T>,Comparator<?superT>)*

public static void sort(
  java.util.List<T> list,
  java.util.Comparator<? super T> c)

Sorts the specified list according to the order induced by the specified comparator. All elements in the list must be mutually comparable using the specified comparator (that is, 
c.compare(e1, e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the list). 

This sort is guaranteed to be stable: equal elements will not be reordered as a result of the sort. 

The sorting algorithm is a modified mergesort (in which the merge is omitted if the highest element in the low sublist is less than the lowest element in the high sublist). This 
algorithm offers guaranteed n log(n) performance.

public static void swap(
  java.util.List<?> list,
  int i,
  int j)

Swaps the elements at the specified positions in the specified list. (If the specified positions are equal, invoking this method leaves the list unchanged.) 


    list - The list in which to swap elements. 
    i - the index of one element to be swapped. 
    j - the index of the other element to be swapped. 

*java.util.Collections.synchronizedCollection(Collection<T>)*

public static |java.util.Collection|<T> synchronizedCollection(java.util.Collection<T> c)

Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) collection backed by the specified collection. In order to guarantee serial access, it is critical that all access to the backing collection 
is accomplished through the returned collection. 

It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned collection when iterating over it: 

Collection c = Collections.synchronizedCollection(myCollection); ... synchronized(c) { Iterator i = c.iterator(); // Must be in the synchronized block while (i.hasNext()) 
foo(i.next()); } 

Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior. 

The returned collection does not pass the hashCode and equals operations through to the backing collection, but relies on Object's equals and hashCode methods. This is necessary 
to preserve the contracts of these operations in the case that the backing collection is a set or a list. 

The returned collection will be serializable if the specified collection is serializable. 


    c - the collection to be "wrapped" in a synchronized collection. 

    Returns: a synchronized view of the specified collection.

Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior.

through the returned map.

Map m = Collections.synchronizedMap(new HashMap()); ... Set s = m.keySet(); // Needn't be in synchronized block ... synchronized(m) { // Synchronizing on m, not s! Iterator i = 
s.iterator(); // Must be in synchronized block while (i.hasNext()) foo(i.next()); } 

Failure to follow this advice may result in non-deterministic behavior.

Returns a synchronized (thread-safe) sorted map backed by the specified sorted map. In order to guarantee serial access, it is critical that all access to the backing sorted map 
is accomplished through the returned sorted map (or its views). 

It is imperative that the user manually synchronize on the returned sorted map when iterating over any of its collection views, or the collections views of any of its subMap, 
headMap or tailMap views. 

SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new HashSortedMap()); ... Set s = m.keySet(); // Needn't be in synchronized block ... synchronized(m) { // Synchronizing on m, not 
s! Iterator i = s.iterator(); // Must be in synchronized block while (i.hasNext()) foo(i.next()); } 

or: 

SortedMap m = Collections.synchronizedSortedMap(new HashSortedMap()); SortedMap m2 = m.subMap(foo, bar); ... Set s2 = m2.keySet(); // Needn't be in synchronized block ...

UnsupportedOperationException. 

The returned collection does not pass the hashCode and equals operations through to the backing collection, but relies on Object's equals and hashCode methods. This is necessary 
to preserve the contracts of these operations in the case that the backing collection is a set or a list.
