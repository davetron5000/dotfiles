*java.awt.dnd.DnDConstants_Description*

This class contains constant values representing the type of action(s) to be performed by a Drag and Drop operation. 



*int_java.awt.dnd.DnDConstants.ACTION_COPY*

An int representing a copy action. 


*int_java.awt.dnd.DnDConstants.ACTION_COPY_OR_MOVE*

An int representing a copy or move action. 


*int_java.awt.dnd.DnDConstants.ACTION_LINK*

An int representing a link action. 

The link verb is found in many, if not all native DnD platforms, and the actual interpretation of LINK semantics is both platform and application dependent. Broadly speaking, the 
semantic is "do not copy, or move the operand, but create a reference to it". Defining the meaning of "reference" is where ambiguity is introduced. 

The verb is provided for completeness, but its use is not recommended for DnD operations between logically distinct applications where misinterpretation of the operations 
semantics could lead to confusing results for the user. 


*int_java.awt.dnd.DnDConstants.ACTION_MOVE*

An int representing a move action. 


*int_java.awt.dnd.DnDConstants.ACTION_NONE*

An int representing no action. 


*int_java.awt.dnd.DnDConstants.ACTION_REFERENCE*

An int representing a reference action (synonym for ACTION_LINK).
