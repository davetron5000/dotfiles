*org.omg.CORBA.Current_Description*

Interfaces derived from the Current interface enable ORB and CORBA services to 
provide access to information (context) associated with the thread of execution 
in which they are running. This information is accessed in a structured manner 
using interfaces derived from the Current interface defined in the CORBA 
module. 

Each ORB or CORBA service that needs its own context derives an interface from 
the CORBA module's Current. Users of the service can obtain an instance of the 
appropriate Current interface by invoking ORB::resolve_initial_references.
