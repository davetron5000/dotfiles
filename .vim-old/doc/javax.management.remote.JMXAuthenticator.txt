*javax.management.remote.JMXAuthenticator_Description*

Interface to define how remote credentials are converted into a JAAS Subject. 
This interface is used by the RMI Connector Server, and can be used by other 
connector servers. 

The user-defined authenticator instance is passed to the connector server in 
the environment map as the value of the attribute 
(|javax.management.remote.JMXConnectorServer|) . For connector servers that use 
only this authentication system, if this attribute is not present or its value 
is null then no user authentication will be performed and full access to the 
methods exported by the MBeanServerConnection object will be allowed. 

If authentication is successful then an authenticated 
subject(|javax.security.auth.Subject|) filled in with its associated 
principals(|java.security.Principal|) is returned. Authorization checks will be 
then performed based on the given set of principals. 


*javax.management.remote.JMXAuthenticator.authenticate(Object)*

public |javax.security.auth.Subject| authenticate(java.lang.Object credentials)

Authenticates the MBeanServerConnection client with the given client 
credentials. 

    credentials - the user-defined credentials to be passed into the server in order to 
       authenticate the user before creating the MBeanServerConnection. The 
       actual type of this parameter, and whether it can be null, depends on 
       the connector. 

    Returns: the authenticated subject containing its associated principals.
