*org.omg.CORBA.NO_IMPLEMENT_Description*

This exception indicates that even though the operation that was invoked exists 
(it has an IDL definition), no implementation for that operation exists. 
NO_IMPLEMENT can, for example, be raised by an ORB if a client asks for an 
object's type definition from the interface repository, but no interface 
repository is provided by the ORB. It contains a minor code, which gives more 
detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion status. 
It may also contain a string describing the exception. 

See the section Minor Code Meanings to see the minor codes for this exception.
