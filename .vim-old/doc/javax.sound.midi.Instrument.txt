*javax.sound.midi.Instrument_Description*

An instrument is a sound-synthesis algorithm with certain parameter settings, 
usually designed to emulate a specific real-world musical instrument or to 
achieve a specific sort of sound effect. Instruments are typically stored in 
collections called soundbanks. Before the instrument can be used to play notes, 
it must first be loaded onto a synthesizer, and then it must be selected for 
use on one or more channels, via a program-change command. MIDI notes that are 
subsequently received on those channels will be played using the sound of the 
selected instrument. 


*javax.sound.midi.Instrument(Soundbank,Patch,String,Class)*

protected Instrument(
  javax.sound.midi.Soundbank soundbank,
  javax.sound.midi.Patch patch,
  java.lang.String name,
  java.lang.Class dataClass)

Constructs a new MIDI instrument from the specified Patch. When a subsequent 
request is made to load the instrument, the sound bank will search its contents 
for this instrument's Patch, and the instrument will be loaded into the 
synthesizer at the bank and program location indicated by the Patch object. 

    soundbank - sound bank containing the instrument 
    patch - the patch of this instrument 
    name - the name of this instrument 
    dataClass - the class used to represent the sample's data. 

*javax.sound.midi.Instrument.getPatch()*

public |javax.sound.midi.Patch| getPatch()

Obtains the Patch object that indicates the bank and program numbers where this 
instrument is to be stored in the synthesizer. 


    Returns: this instrument's patch
