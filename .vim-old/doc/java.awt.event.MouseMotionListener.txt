|java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener.mouseDragged(MouseEvent)|Invoked when a mouse button is pressed on a component and then   dragged.

*java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener_Description*

The listener interface for receiving mouse motion events on a component. (For clicks and other mouse events, use the MouseListener.) 

The class that is interested in processing a mouse motion event either implements this interface (and all the methods it contains) or extends the abstract MouseMotionAdapter class 
(overriding only the methods of interest). 

The listener object created from that class is then registered with a component using the component's addMouseMotionListener method. A mouse motion event is generated when the 
mouse is moved or dragged. (Many such events will be generated). When a mouse motion event occurs, the relevant method in the listener object is invoked, and the MouseEvent is 
passed to it. 



*java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener.mouseDragged(MouseEvent)*

public void mouseDragged(java.awt.event.MouseEvent e)

Invoked when a mouse button is pressed on a component and then dragged. MOUSE_DRAGGED events will continue to be delivered to the component where the drag originated until the 
mouse button is released (regardless of whether the mouse position is within the bounds of the component). 

Due to platform-dependent Dragimplementations, MOUSE_DRAGGED events may not be delivered during a native Dragoperation. 



*java.awt.event.MouseMotionListener.mouseMoved(MouseEvent)*

public void mouseMoved(java.awt.event.MouseEvent e)

Invoked when the mouse cursor has been moved onto a component but no buttons have been pushed.
