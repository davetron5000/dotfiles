*java.util.Date_Description*

The class Date represents a specific instant in time, with millisecond precision. 

Prior to JDK1.1, the class Date had two additional functions. It allowed the interpretation of dates as year, month, day, hour, minute, and second values. It also allowed the 
formatting and parsing of date strings. Unfortunately, the API for these functions was not amenable to internationalization. As of JDK1.1, the Calendar class should be used to 
convert between dates and time fields and the DateFormat class should be used to format and parse date strings. The corresponding methods in Date are deprecated. 

Although the Date class is intended to reflect coordinated universal time (UTC), it may not do so exactly, depending on the host environment of the Java Virtual Machine. Nearly 
all modern operating systems assume that 1day= 246060= 86400 seconds in all cases. In UTC, however, about once every year or two there is an extra second, called a "leap second." 
The leap second is always added as the last second of the day, and always on December 31 or June 30. For example, the last minute of the year 1995 was 61 seconds long, thanks to 
an added leap second. Most computer clocks are not accurate enough to be able to reflect the leap-second distinction. 

Some computer standards are defined in terms of Greenwich mean time (GMT), which is equivalent to universal time (UT). GMT is the "civil" name for the standard; UT is the 
"scientific" name for the same standard. The distinction between UTC and UT is that UTC is based on an atomic clock and UT is based on astronomical observations, which for all 
practical purposes is an invisibly fine hair to split. Because the earth's rotation is not uniform (it slows down and speeds up in complicated ways), UT does not always flow 
uniformly. Leap seconds are introduced as needed into UTC so as to keep UTC within 0.9 seconds of UT1, which is a version of UT with certain corrections applied. There are other 
time and date systems as well; for example, the time scale used by the satellite-based global positioning system (GPS) is synchronized to UTC but is not adjusted for leap seconds. 
An interesting source of further information is the U.S. Naval Observatory, particularly the Directorate of Time at: 

http://tycho.usno.navy.mil 

and their definitions of "Systems of Time" at: 

http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/systime.html 

In all methods of class Date that accept or return year, month, date, hours, minutes, and seconds values, the following representations are used: 

A year y is represented by the integer y-1900. A month is represented by an integer from 0 to 11; 0 is January, 1 is February, and so forth; thus 11 is December. A date (day of 
month) is represented by an integer from 1 to 31 in the usual manner. An hour is represented by an integer from 0 to 23. Thus, the hour from midnight to 1 a.m. is hour 0, and the 
hour from noon to 1 p.m. is hour 12. A minute is represented by an integer from 0 to 59 in the usual manner. A second is represented by an integer from 0 to 61; the values 60 and 
61 occur only for leap seconds and even then only in Java implementations that actually track leap seconds correctly. Because of the manner in which leap seconds are currently 
introduced, it is extremely unlikely that two leap seconds will occur in the same minute, but this specification follows the date and time conventions for ISO C. 

In all cases, arguments given to methods for these purposes need not fall within the indicated ranges; for example, a date may be specified as January 32 and is interpreted as 
meaning February 1.

that take leap seconds into account. 

    Deprecated: As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by <code>Calendar.get(Calendar.SECOND)</code>.


    Returns: the number of seconds past the minute represented by this date. 

*java.util.Date.getTime()*

public long getTime()

Returns the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT represented by this Date object. 



    Returns: the number of milliseconds since January 1, 1970, 00:00:00 GMT represented by this date. 

*java.util.Date.getTimezoneOffset()*

public int getTimezoneOffset()

Returns the offset, measured in minutes, for the local time zone relative to UTC that is appropriate for the time represented by this Date object. 

For example, in Massachusetts, five time zones west of Greenwich: 

new Date(96, 1, 14).getTimezoneOffset() returns 300 

because on February 14, 1996, standard time (Eastern Standard Time) is in use, which is offset five hours from UTC; but: 

new Date(96, 5, 1).getTimezoneOffset() returns 240 

because on June 1, 1996, daylight saving time (Eastern Daylight Time) is in use, which is offset only four hours from UTC. This method produces the same result as if it computed: 

(this.getTime() - UTC(this.getYear(), this.getMonth(), this.getDate(), this.getHours(), this.getMinutes(), this.getSeconds())) / (60 * 1000) 

    Deprecated: As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by <code>-(Calendar.get(Calendar.ZONE_OFFSET) +
 Calendar.get(Calendar.DST_OFFSET)) / (60 * 1000)</code>.


    Returns: the time-zone offset, in minutes, for the current time zone. 

*java.util.Date.getYear()*

public int getYear()

Returns a value that is the result of subtracting 1900 from the year that contains or begins with the instant in time represented by this Date object, as interpreted in the local 
time zone. 

    Deprecated: As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by <code>Calendar.get(Calendar.YEAR) - 1900</code>.


    Returns: the year represented by this date, minus 1900. 

*java.util.Date.hashCode()*

public int hashCode()

Returns a hash code value for this object. The result is the exclusive OR of the two halves of the primitive long value returned by the (|java.util.Date|) method. That is, the 
hash code is the value of the expression: 

(int)(this.getTime()^(this.getTime() >>> 32)) 



    Returns: a hash code value for this object. 

*java.util.Date.parse(String)*

public static long parse(java.lang.String s)

Attempts to interpret the string s as a representation of a date and time. If the attempt is successful, the time indicated is returned represented as the distance, measured in 
milliseconds, of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on January 1, 1970). If the attempt fails, an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. 

It accepts many syntaxes; in particular, it recognizes the IETF standard date syntax: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT". It also understands the continental U.S. time-zone 
abbreviations, but for general use, a time-zone offset should be used: "Sat, 12 Aug 1995 13:30:00 GMT+0430" (4 hours, 30 minutes west of the Greenwich meridian). If no time zone 
is specified, the local time zone is assumed. GMT and UTC are considered equivalent. 

The string s is processed from left to right, looking for data of interest. Any material in s that is within the ASCII parenthesis characters ( and ) is ignored. Parentheses may 
be nested. Otherwise, the only characters permitted within s are these ASCII characters: 

abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ 0123456789,+-:/ 

and whitespace characters. A consecutive sequence of decimal digits is treated as a decimal number: If a number is preceded by + or - and a year has already been recognized, then 
the number is a time-zone offset. If the number is less than 24, it is an offset measured in hours. Otherwise, it is regarded as an offset in minutes, expressed in 24-hour time 
format without punctuation. A preceding - means a westward offset. Time zone offsets are always relative to UTC (Greenwich). Thus, for example, -5 occurring in the string would 
mean "five hours west of Greenwich" and +0430 would mean "four hours and thirty minutes east of Greenwich." It is permitted for the string to specify GMT, UT, or UTC 
redundantly-for example, GMT-5 or utc+0430. The number is regarded as a year number if one of the following conditions is true: 

The number is equal to or greater than 70 and followed by a space, comma, slash, or end of string The number is less than 70, and both a month and a day of the month have already 
been recognized 

If the recognized year number is less than 100, it is interpreted as an abbreviated year relative to a century of which dates are within 80 years before and 19 years after the 
time when the Date class is initialized. After adjusting the year number, 1900 is subtracted from it. For example, if the current year is 1999 then years in the range 19 to 99 are 
assumed to mean 1919 to 1999, while years from 0 to 18 are assumed to mean 2000 to 2018. Note that this is slightly different from the interpretation of years less than 100 that 
is used in (|java.text.SimpleDateFormat|) . If the number is followed by a colon, it is regarded as an hour, unless an hour has already been recognized, in which case it is 
regarded as a minute. If the number is followed by a slash, it is regarded as a month (it is decreased by 1 to produce a number in the range 0 to 11), unless a month has already 
been recognized, in which case it is regarded as a day of the month. If the number is followed by whitespace, a comma, a hyphen, or end of string, then if an hour has been 
recognized but not a minute, it is regarded as a minute; otherwise, if a minute has been recognized but not a second, it is regarded as a second; otherwise, it is regarded as a 
day of the month. A consecutive sequence of letters is regarded as a word and treated as follows: A word that matches AM, ignoring case, is ignored (but the parse fails if an hour 
has not been recognized or is less than 1 or greater than 12). A word that matches PM, ignoring case, adds 12 to the hour (but the parse fails if an hour has not been recognized 
or is less than 1 or greater than 12). Any word that matches any prefix of SUNDAY, MONDAY, TUESDAY, WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, FRIDAY, or SATURDAY, ignoring case, is ignored. For 
example, sat, Friday, TUE, and Thurs are ignored. Otherwise, any word that matches any prefix of JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, 
NOVEMBER, or DECEMBER, ignoring case, and considering them in the order given here, is recognized as specifying a month and is converted to a number (0 to 11). For example, aug, 
Sept, april, and NOV are recognized as months. So is Ma, which is recognized as MARCH, not MAY. Any word that matches GMT, UT, or UTC, ignoring case, is treated as referring to 
UTC. Any word that matches EST, CST, MST, or PST, ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the time zone in North America that is five, six, seven, or eight hours west of 
Greenwich, respectively. Any word that matches EDT, CDT, MDT, or PDT, ignoring case, is recognized as referring to the same time zone, respectively, during daylight saving time. 
Once the entire string s has been scanned, it is converted to a time result in one of two ways. If a time zone or time-zone offset has been recognized, then the year, month, day 
of month, hour, minute, and second are interpreted in UTC and then the time-zone offset is applied. Otherwise, the year, month, day of month, hour, minute, and second are 
interpreted in the local time zone.

with the year, month, hour, minute, and second the same as before, as interpreted in the local time zone. If the date was April 30, for example, and the date is set to 31, then it 
will be treated as if it were on May 1, because April has only 30 days. 

    Deprecated: As of JDK version 1.1,

Sets the month of this date to the specified value. This Date object is modified so that it represents a point in time within the specified month, with the year, date, hour, 
minute, and second the same as before, as interpreted in the local time zone. If the date was October 31, for example, and the month is set to June, then the new date will be 
treated as if it were on July 1, because June has only 30 days.

month, date, hour, minute, and second the same as before, as interpreted in the local time zone. (Of course, if the date was February 29, for example, and the year is set to a 
non-leap year, then the new date will be treated as if it were on March 1.) 

    Deprecated: As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by <code>Calendar.set(Calendar.YEAR, year + 1900)</code>.

    year - the year value.

the minute, exactly as for the Date constructor with six arguments, except that the arguments are interpreted relative to UTC rather than to the local time zone. The time 
indicated is returned represented as the distance, measured in milliseconds, of that time from the epoch (00:00:00 GMT on January 1, 1970). 

    Deprecated: As of JDK version 1.1,
 replaced by <code>Calendar.set(year + 1900, month, date,
 hrs, min, sec)</code> or <code>GregorianCalendar(year + 1900,
 month, date, hrs, min, sec)</code>, using a UTC
 <code>TimeZone</code>, followed by <code>Calendar.getTime().getTime()</code>.

    month - the month between 0-11. 
    date - the day of the month between 1-31. 
    hrs - the hours between 0-23. 
    min - the minutes between 0-59.
