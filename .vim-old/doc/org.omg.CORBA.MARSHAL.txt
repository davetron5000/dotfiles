*org.omg.CORBA.MARSHAL_Description*

A request or reply from the network is structurally invalid. This error 
typically indicates a bug in either the client-side or server-side run time. 
For example, if a reply from the server indicates that the message contains 
1000 bytes, but the actual message is shorter or longer than 1000 bytes, the 
ORB raises this exception. MARSHAL can also be caused by using the DII or DSI 
incorrectly, for example, if the type of the actual parameters sent does not 
agree with IDL signature of an operation. It contains a minor code, which gives 
more detailed information about what caused the exception, and a completion 
status. It may also contain a string describing the exception. 

See the section Minor Code Meanings to see the minor codes for this exception. 


*org.omg.CORBA.MARSHAL()*

public MARSHAL()
