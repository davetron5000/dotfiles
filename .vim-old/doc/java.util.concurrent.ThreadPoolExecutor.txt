*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor_Description*

An (|java.util.concurrent.ExecutorService|) that executes each submitted task using one of possibly several pooled threads, normally configured using 
(|java.util.concurrent.Executors|) factory methods. 

Thread pools address two different problems: they usually provide improved performance when executing large numbers of asynchronous tasks, due to reduced per-task invocation 
overhead, and they provide a means of bounding and managing the resources, including threads, consumed when executing a collection of tasks. Each ThreadPoolExecutor also maintains 
some basic statistics, such as the number of completed tasks. 

To be useful across a wide range of contexts, this class provides many adjustable parameters and extensibility hooks. However, programmers are urged to use the more convenient 
(|java.util.concurrent.Executors|) factory methods (|java.util.concurrent.Executors|) (unbounded thread pool, with automatic thread reclamation), 
(|java.util.concurrent.Executors|) (fixed size thread pool) and (|java.util.concurrent.Executors|) (single background thread), that preconfigure settings for the most common usage 
scenarios. Otherwise, use the following guide when manually configuring and tuning this class: 



Core and maximum pool sizes 

A ThreadPoolExecutor will automatically adjust the pool size (see (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) ) according to the bounds set by corePoolSize (see 
(|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) ) and maximumPoolSize (see (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) ). When a new task is submitted in method 
(|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) , and fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, a new thread is created to handle the request, even if other worker threads are 
idle. If there are more than corePoolSize but less than maximumPoolSize threads running, a new thread will be created only if the queue is full. By setting corePoolSize and 
maximumPoolSize the same, you create a fixed-size thread pool. By setting maximumPoolSize to an essentially unbounded value such as Integer.MAX_VALUE, you allow the pool to 
accommodate an arbitrary number of concurrent tasks. Most typically, core and maximum pool sizes are set only upon construction, but they may also be changed dynamically using 
(|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) and (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) . 

On-demand construction 

By default, even core threads are initially created and started only when needed by new tasks, but this can be overridden dynamically using method 
(|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) or (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) . 

Creating new threads 

New threads are created using a (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory|) . If not otherwise specified, a (|java.util.concurrent.Executors|) is used, that creates threads to all be 
in the same (|java.lang.ThreadGroup|) and with the same NORM_PRIORITY priority and non-daemon status. By supplying a different ThreadFactory, you can alter the thread's name, 
thread group, priority, daemon status, etc. If a ThreadFactory fails to create a thread when asked by returning null from newThread, the executor will continue, but might not be 
able to execute any tasks. 

Keep-alive times 

If the pool currently has more than corePoolSize threads, excess threads will be terminated if they have been idle for more than the keepAliveTime (see 
(|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) ). This provides a means of reducing resource consumption when the pool is not being actively used. If the pool becomes more active 
later, new threads will be constructed. This parameter can also be changed dynamically using method (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) . Using a value of Long.MAX_VALUE 
(|java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit|) effectively disables idle threads from ever terminating prior to shut down. 

Queuing 

Any (|java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue|) may be used to transfer and hold submitted tasks. The use of this queue interacts with pool sizing: 



If fewer than corePoolSize threads are running, the Executor always prefers adding a new thread rather than queuing. 

If corePoolSize or more threads are running, the Executor always prefers queuing a request rather than adding a new thread. 

If a request cannot be queued, a new thread is created unless this would exceed maximumPoolSize, in which case, the task will be rejected. 



There are three general strategies for queuing: 

Direct handoffs. A good default choice for a work queue is a (|java.util.concurrent.SynchronousQueue|) that hands off tasks to threads without otherwise holding them. Here, an 
attempt to queue a task will fail if no threads are immediately available to run it, so a new thread will be constructed. This policy avoids lockups when handling sets of requests 
that might have internal dependencies. Direct handoffs generally require unbounded maximumPoolSizes to avoid rejection of new submitted tasks. This in turn admits the possibility 
of unbounded thread growth when commands continue to arrive on average faster than they can be processed. 

Unbounded queues. Using an unbounded queue (for example a (|java.util.concurrent.LinkedBlockingQueue|) without a predefined capacity) will cause new tasks to be queued in cases 
where all corePoolSize threads are busy. Thus, no more than corePoolSize threads will ever be created. (And the value of the maximumPoolSize therefore doesn't have any effect.) 
This may be appropriate when each task is completely independent of others, so tasks cannot affect each others execution; for example, in a web page server. While this style of 
queuing can be useful in smoothing out transient bursts of requests, it admits the possibility of unbounded work queue growth when commands continue to arrive on average faster 
than they can be processed. 

Bounded queues. A bounded queue (for example, an (|java.util.concurrent.ArrayBlockingQueue|) ) helps prevent resource exhaustion when used with finite maximumPoolSizes, but can be 
more difficult to tune and control. Queue sizes and maximum pool sizes may be traded off for each other: Using large queues and small pools minimizes CPU usage, OS resources, and 
context-switching overhead, but can lead to artificially low throughput. If tasks frequently block (for example if they are I/O bound), a system may be able to schedule time for 
more threads than you otherwise allow. Use of small queues generally requires larger pool sizes, which keeps CPUs busier but may encounter unacceptable scheduling overhead, which 
also decreases throughput. 





Rejected tasks 

New tasks submitted in method (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) will be rejected when the Executor has been shut down, and also when the Executor uses finite bounds for 
both maximum threads and work queue capacity, and is saturated. In either case, the execute method invokes the (|java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler|) method of its 
(|java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler|) . Four predefined handler policies are provided: 



In the default (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.AbortPolicy|) , the handler throws a runtime (|java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionException|) upon rejection. 

In (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.CallerRunsPolicy|) , the thread that invokes execute itself runs the task. This provides a simple feedback control mechanism that will 
slow down the rate that new tasks are submitted. 

In (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardPolicy|) , a task that cannot be executed is simply dropped. 

In (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.DiscardOldestPolicy|) , if the executor is not shut down, the task at the head of the work queue is dropped, and then execution is 
retried (which can fail again, causing this to be repeated.) 



It is possible to define and use other kinds of (|java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler|) classes. Doing so requires some care especially when policies are designed to 
work only under particular capacity or queuing policies. 

Hook methods 

This class provides protected overridable (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) and (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) methods that are called before and after 
execution of each task. These can be used to manipulate the execution environment; for example, reinitializing ThreadLocals, gathering statistics, or adding log entries. 
Additionally, method (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) can be overridden to perform any special processing that needs to be done once the Executor has fully terminated. 

If hook or callback methods throw exceptions, internal worker threads may in turn fail and abruptly terminate. 

Queue maintenance 

Method (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) allows access to the work queue for purposes of monitoring and debugging. Use of this method for any other purpose is strongly 
discouraged. Two supplied methods, (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) and (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) are available to assist in storage reclamation when 
large numbers of queued tasks become cancelled. 

Extension example. Most extensions of this class override one or more of the protected hook methods. For example, here is a subclass that adds a simple pause/resume feature: 



class PausableThreadPoolExecutor extends ThreadPoolExecutor { private boolean isPaused; private ReentrantLock pauseLock = new ReentrantLock(); private Condition unpaused = 
pauseLock.newCondition(); 

public PausableThreadPoolExecutor(...) { super(...); } 

protected void beforeExecute(Thread t, Runnable r) { super.beforeExecute(t, r); pauseLock.lock(); try { while (isPaused) unpaused.await(); } catch(InterruptedException ie) { 
t.interrupt(); } finally { pauseLock.unlock(); } } 

public void pause() { pauseLock.lock(); try { isPaused = true; } finally { pauseLock.unlock(); } } 

public void resume() { pauseLock.lock(); try { isPaused = false; unpaused.signalAll(); } finally { pauseLock.unlock(); } } }

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.afterExecute(Runnable,Throwable)*

protected void afterExecute(
  java.lang.Runnable r,
  java.lang.Throwable t)

Method invoked upon completion of execution of the given Runnable. This method is invoked by the thread that executed the task. If non-null, the Throwable is the uncaught 
exception that caused execution to terminate abruptly. Note: To properly nest multiple overridings, subclasses should generally invoke super.afterExecute at the beginning of this 
method. 


    r - the runnable that has completed. 
    t - the exception that caused termination, or null if execution completed normally. 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.awaitTermination(long,TimeUnit)*

public boolean awaitTermination(

  throws |java.lang.InterruptedException|
         




*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.beforeExecute(Thread,Runnable)*

protected void beforeExecute(
  java.lang.Thread t,
  java.lang.Runnable r)

Method invoked prior to executing the given Runnable in the given thread. This method is invoked by thread t that will execute task r, and may be used to re-initialize 
ThreadLocals, or to perform logging. Note: To properly nest multiple overridings, subclasses should generally invoke super.beforeExecute at the end of this method. 


    t - the thread that will run task r. 
    r - the task that will be executed. 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.execute(Runnable)*

public void execute(java.lang.Runnable command)

Executes the given task sometime in the future. The task may execute in a new thread or in an existing pooled thread. 

If the task cannot be submitted for execution, either because this executor has been shutdown or because its capacity has been reached, the task is handled by the current 
RejectedExecutionHandler. 


    command - the task to execute 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.finalize()*

protected void finalize()

Invokes shutdown when this executor is no longer referenced. 



*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getActiveCount()*

    Returns: the number of threads 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getCompletedTaskCount()*

public long getCompletedTaskCount()

Returns the approximate total number of tasks that have completed execution. Because the states of tasks and threads may change dynamically during computation, the returned value 
is only an approximation, but one that does not ever decrease across successive calls. 



    Returns: the number of tasks 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getCorePoolSize()*

public int getCorePoolSize()

Returns the core number of threads. 



    Returns: the core number of threads

public long getKeepAliveTime(java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit unit)

Returns the thread keep-alive time, which is the amount of time which threads in excess of the core pool size may remain idle before being terminated. 


    unit - the desired time unit of the result 

    Returns: the time limit 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getLargestPoolSize()*

public int getLargestPoolSize()

Returns the largest number of threads that have ever simultaneously been in the pool. 



    Returns: the number of threads

Returns the maximum allowed number of threads. 



    Returns: the maximum allowed number of threads 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getPoolSize()*

public int getPoolSize()

Returns the current number of threads in the pool. 



    Returns: the number of threads 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getQueue()*

public |java.util.concurrent.BlockingQueue|<Runnable> getQueue()

Returns the task queue used by this executor. Access to the task queue is intended primarily for debugging and monitoring. This queue may be in active use. Retrieving the task 
queue does not prevent queued tasks from executing. 



    Returns: the task queue 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getRejectedExecutionHandler()*

public |java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler| getRejectedExecutionHandler()

Returns the current handler for unexecutable tasks. 



    Returns: the current handler 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getTaskCount()*

public long getTaskCount()

Returns the approximate total number of tasks that have been scheduled for execution. Because the states of tasks and threads may change dynamically during computation, the 
returned value is only an approximation, but one that does not ever decrease across successive calls. 



    Returns: the number of tasks 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.getThreadFactory()*

public |java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory| getThreadFactory()

Returns the thread factory used to create new threads. 



    Returns: the current thread factory 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.isShutdown()*

public boolean isShutdown()





*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.isTerminated()*

public boolean isTerminated()





*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.isTerminating()*

public boolean isTerminating()

Returns true if this executor is in the process of terminating after shutdown or shutdownNow but has not completely terminated. This method may be useful for debugging. A return 
of true reported a sufficient period after shutdown may indicate that submitted tasks have ignored or suppressed interruption, causing this executor not to properly terminate. 



    Returns: true if terminating but not yet terminated. 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.prestartAllCoreThreads()*

public int prestartAllCoreThreads()

Starts all core threads, causing them to idly wait for work. This overrides the default policy of starting core threads only when new tasks are executed. 



    Returns: the number of threads started. 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.prestartCoreThread()*

public boolean prestartCoreThread()

Starts a core thread, causing it to idly wait for work. This overrides the default policy of starting core threads only when new tasks are executed. This method will return false 
if all core threads have already been started. 



    Returns: true if a thread was started 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.purge()*

public void purge()

Tries to remove from the work queue all (|java.util.concurrent.Future|) tasks that have been cancelled. This method can be useful as a storage reclamation operation, that has no 
other impact on functionality. Cancelled tasks are never executed, but may accumulate in work queues until worker threads can actively remove them. Invoking this method instead 
tries to remove them now. However, this method may fail to remove tasks in the presence of interference by other threads. 



*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.remove(Runnable)*

public boolean remove(java.lang.Runnable task)

Removes this task from the executor's internal queue if it is present, thus causing it not to be run if it has not already started. 

This method may be useful as one part of a cancellation scheme. It may fail to remove tasks that have been converted into other forms before being placed on the internal queue. 
For example, a task entered using submit might be converted into a form that maintains Future status. However, in such cases, method (|java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor|) 
may be used to remove those Futures that have been cancelled. 


    task - the task to remove 

    Returns: true if the task was removed 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.setCorePoolSize(int)*

public void setCorePoolSize(int corePoolSize)

Sets the core number of threads. This overrides any value set in the constructor. If the new value is smaller than the current value, excess existing threads will be terminated 
when they next become idle. If larger, new threads will, if needed, be started to execute any queued tasks. 


    corePoolSize - the new core size 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.setKeepAliveTime(long,TimeUnit)*

public void setKeepAliveTime(
  long time,
  java.util.concurrent.TimeUnit unit)

Sets the time limit for which threads may remain idle before being terminated. If there are more than the core number of threads currently in the pool, after waiting this amount 
of time without processing a task, excess threads will be terminated. This overrides any value set in the constructor. 


    time - the time to wait. A time value of zero will cause excess threads to terminate immediately after executing tasks. 
    unit - the time unit of the time argument 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.setMaximumPoolSize(int)*

public void setMaximumPoolSize(int maximumPoolSize)

Sets the maximum allowed number of threads. This overrides any value set in the constructor. If the new value is smaller than the current value, excess existing threads will be 
terminated when they next become idle. 


    maximumPoolSize - the new maximum 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.setRejectedExecutionHandler(RejectedExecutionHandler)*

public void setRejectedExecutionHandler(java.util.concurrent.RejectedExecutionHandler handler)

Sets a new handler for unexecutable tasks. 


    handler - the new handler 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.setThreadFactory(ThreadFactory)*

public void setThreadFactory(java.util.concurrent.ThreadFactory threadFactory)

Sets the thread factory used to create new threads. 


    threadFactory - the new thread factory 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.shutdown()*

public void shutdown()

Initiates an orderly shutdown in which previously submitted tasks are executed, but no new tasks will be accepted. Invocation has no additional effect if already shut down. 



*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.shutdownNow()*

public |java.util.List|<Runnable> shutdownNow()

Attempts to stop all actively executing tasks, halts the processing of waiting tasks, and returns a list of the tasks that were awaiting execution. 

This implementation cancels tasks via (|java.lang.Thread|) , so if any tasks mask or fail to respond to interrupts, they may never terminate. 



    Returns: list of tasks that never commenced execution 

*java.util.concurrent.ThreadPoolExecutor.terminated()*

protected void terminated()

Method invoked when the Executor has terminated. Default implementation does nothing. Note: To properly nest multiple overridings, subclasses should generally invoke 
super.terminated within this method.
