*javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info_Description*

A Line.Info object contains information about a line. The only information 
provided by Line.Info itself is the Java class of the line. A subclass of 
Line.Info adds other kinds of information about the line. This additional 
information depends on which Line subinterface is implemented by the kind of 
line that the Line.Info subclass describes. 

A Line.Info can be retrieved using various methods of the Line, Mixer, and 
AudioSystem interfaces. Other such methods let you pass a Line.Info as an 
argument, to learn whether lines matching the specified configuration are 
available and to obtain them. 


*javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info(Class)*

public Line.Info(java.lang.Class lineClass)

Constructs an info object that describes a line of the specified class. This 
constructor is typically used by an application to describe a desired line. 

    lineClass - the class of the line that the new Line.Info object describes 

*javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info.getLineClass()*

public |java.lang.Class| getLineClass()

Obtains the class of the line that this Line.Info object describes. 


    Returns: the described line's class 
*javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info.matches(Line.Info)*

public boolean matches(javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info info)

Indicates whether the specified info object matches this one. To match, the 
specified object must be identical to or a special case of this one. The 
specified info object must be either an instance of the same class as this one, 
or an instance of a sub-type of this one. In addition, the attributes of the 
specified object must be compatible with the capabilities of this one. 
Specifically, the routing configuration for the specified info object must be 
compatible with that of this one. Subclasses may add other criteria to 
determine whether the two objects match. 

    info - the info object which is being compared to this one 

    Returns: true if the specified object matches this one, false otherwise 
*javax.sound.sampled.Line.Info.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Obtains a textual description of the line info. 


    Returns: a string description
