*javax.servlet.SingleThreadModel_Description*

Ensures that servlets handle only one request at a time. This interface has no 
methods. 

If a servlet implements this interface, you are guaranteed that no two threads 
will execute concurrently in the servlet's service method. The servlet 
container can make this guarantee by synchronizing access to a single instance 
of the servlet, or by maintaining a pool of servlet instances and dispatching 
each new request to a free servlet. 

Note that SingleThreadModel does not solve all thread safety issues. For 
example, session attributes and static variables can still be accessed by 
multiple requests on multiple threads at the same time, even when 
SingleThreadModel servlets are used. It is recommended that a developer take 
other means to resolve those issues instead of implementing this interface, 
such as avoiding the usage of an instance variable or synchronizing the block 
of the code accessing those resources. This interface is deprecated in Servlet 
API version 2.4. 


  Deprecated: As of Java Servlet API 2.4, with no direct
	replacement.
