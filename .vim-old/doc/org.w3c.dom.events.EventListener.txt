*org.w3c.dom.events.EventListener_Description*

The EventListener interface is the primary method for handling events. Users 
implement the EventListener interface and register their listener on an 
EventTarget using the AddEventListener method. The users should also remove 
their EventListener from its EventTarget after they have completed using the 
listener. When a Node is copied using the cloneNode method the EventListeners 
attached to the source Node are not attached to the copied Node. If the user 
wishes the same EventListeners to be added to the newly created copy the user 
must add them manually. See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Events 
Specification. 


*org.w3c.dom.events.EventListener.handleEvent(Event)*

public void handleEvent(org.w3c.dom.events.Event evt)

This method is called whenever an event occurs of the type for which the 
EventListener interface was registered. 

    evt - The Event contains contextual information about the event. It also contains the 
       stopPropagation and preventDefault methods which are used in determining 
       the event's flow and default action.
