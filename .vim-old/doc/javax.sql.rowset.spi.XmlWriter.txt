*javax.sql.rowset.spi.XmlWriter_Description*

A specialized interface that facilitates an extension of the SyncProvider abstract class for XML orientated synchronization providers. 

SyncProvider implementations that supply XML data writer capabilities such as output XML stream capabilities can implement this interface to provider standard XmlWriter objects to 
WebRowSet implementations. 

Writing a WebRowSet object includes printing the rowset's data, metadata, and properties, all with the appropriate XML tags. 



*javax.sql.rowset.spi.XmlWriter.writeXML(WebRowSet,Writer)*

public void writeXML(
  javax.sql.rowset.WebRowSet caller,
  java.io.Writer writer)
  throws |java.sql.SQLException|
         
Writes the given WebRowSet object to the specified java.io.Writer output stream as an XML document. This document includes the rowset's data, metadata, and properties plus the 
appropriate XML tags. 

The caller parameter must be a WebRowSet object whose XmlWriter field contains a reference to this XmlWriter object. 


    caller - the WebRowSet instance to be written, for which this XmlWriter object is the writer 
    writer - the java.io.Writer object that serves as the output stream for writing caller as an XML document
