*java.util.PriorityQueue_Description*

An unbounded priority queue(|java.util.Queue|) based on a priority heap. This queue orders elements according to an order specified at construction time, which is specified either 
according to their natural order (see (|java.lang.Comparable|) ), or according to a (|java.util.Comparator|) , depending on which constructor is used. A priority queue does not 
permit null elements. A priority queue relying on natural ordering also does not permit insertion of non-comparable objects (doing so may result in ClassCastException). 

The head of this queue is the least element with respect to the specified ordering. If multiple elements are tied for least value, the head is one of those elements -- ties are 
broken arbitrarily. The queue retrieval operations poll, remove, peek, and element access the element at the head of the queue. 

A priority queue is unbounded, but has an internal capacity governing the size of an array used to store the elements on the queue. It is always at least as large as the queue 
size. As elements are added to a priority queue, its capacity grows automatically. The details of the growth policy are not specified. 

This class and its iterator implement all of the optional methods of the (|java.util.Collection|) and (|java.util.Iterator|) interfaces. The Iterator provided in method 
(|java.util.PriorityQueue|) is not guaranteed to traverse the elements of the PriorityQueue in any particular order. If you need ordered traversal, consider using 
Arrays.sort(pq.toArray()). 

Note that this implementation is not synchronized. Multiple threads should not access a PriorityQueue instance concurrently if any of the threads modifies the list structurally. 
Instead, use the thread-safe (|java.util.concurrent.PriorityBlockingQueue|) class. 

Implementation note: this implementation provides O(log(n)) time for the insertion methods (offer, poll, remove() and add) methods; linear time for the remove(Object) and 
contains(Object) methods; and constant time for the retrieval methods (peek, element, and size).

*java.util.PriorityQueue()*

public PriorityQueue()

Creates a PriorityQueue with the default initial capacity (11) that orders its elements according to their natural ordering (using Comparable). 


*java.util.PriorityQueue(Collection<?extendsE>)*

public PriorityQueue(java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Creates a PriorityQueue containing the elements in the specified collection. The priority queue has an initial capacity of 110% of the size of the specified collection or 1 if the 
collection is empty. If the specified collection is an instance of a (|java.util.SortedSet|) or is another PriorityQueue, the priority queue will be sorted according to the same 
comparator, or according to its elements' natural order if the collection is sorted according to its elements' natural order. Otherwise, the priority queue is ordered according to 
its elements' natural order. 

    c - the collection whose elements are to be placed into this priority queue. 

*java.util.PriorityQueue(int)*

public PriorityQueue(int initialCapacity)

Creates a PriorityQueue with the specified initial capacity that orders its elements according to their natural ordering (using Comparable). 

    initialCapacity - the initial capacity for this priority queue. 

*java.util.PriorityQueue(int,Comparator<?superE>)*

public PriorityQueue(
  int initialCapacity,
  java.util.Comparator<? super E> comparator)

Creates a PriorityQueue with the specified initial capacity that orders its elements according to the specified comparator. 

    initialCapacity - the initial capacity for this priority queue. 
    comparator - the comparator used to order this priority queue. If null then the order depends on the elements' natural ordering. 

*java.util.PriorityQueue(PriorityQueue<?extendsE>)*

public PriorityQueue(java.util.PriorityQueue<? extends E> c)

Creates a PriorityQueue containing the elements in the specified collection. The priority queue has an initial capacity of 110% of the size of the specified collection or 1 if the 
collection is empty. This priority queue will be sorted according to the same comparator as the given collection, or according to its elements' natural order if the collection is 
sorted according to its elements' natural order. 

    c - the collection whose elements are to be placed into this priority queue. 

*java.util.PriorityQueue(SortedSet<?extendsE>)*

public PriorityQueue(java.util.SortedSet<? extends E> c)

Creates a PriorityQueue containing the elements in the specified collection. The priority queue has an initial capacity of 110% of the size of the specified collection or 1 if the 
collection is empty. This priority queue will be sorted according to the same comparator as the given collection, or according to its elements' natural order if the collection is 
sorted according to its elements' natural order. 

    c - the collection whose elements are to be placed into this priority queue. 

*java.util.PriorityQueue.add(E)*

public boolean add(E o)

Adds the specified element to this queue. 



    Returns: true (as per the general contract of Collection.add). 

*java.util.PriorityQueue.clear()*

public void clear()

Removes all elements from the priority queue. The queue will be empty after this call returns. 



*java.util.PriorityQueue.comparator()*

public |java.util.Comparator|<? super E> comparator()

Returns the comparator used to order this collection, or null if this collection is sorted according to its elements natural ordering (using Comparable). 



    Returns: the comparator used to order this collection, or null if this collection is sorted according to its elements natural ordering. 

*java.util.PriorityQueue.iterator()*

public |java.util.Iterator|<E> iterator()

Returns an iterator over the elements in this queue. The iterator does not return the elements in any particular order. 



    Returns: an iterator over the elements in this queue. 

*java.util.PriorityQueue.offer(E)*

public boolean offer(E o)

Inserts the specified element into this priority queue. 



    Returns: 

*java.util.PriorityQueue.peek()*

public |E| peek()





*java.util.PriorityQueue.poll()*

public |E| poll()





*java.util.PriorityQueue.remove(Object)*

public boolean remove(java.lang.Object o)

Removes a single instance of the specified element from this queue, if it is present. 



*java.util.PriorityQueue.size()*

public int size()
