*org.w3c.dom.Comment_Description*

This interface inherits from CharacterData and represents the content of a 
comment, i.e., all the characters between the starting ' <!--' and ending 
'-->'. Note that this is the definition of a comment in XML, and, in practice, 
HTML, although some HTML tools may implement the full SGML comment structure. 
No lexical check is done on the content of a comment and it is therefore 
possible to have the character sequence "--" (double-hyphen) in the content, 
which is illegal in a comment per section 2.5 of [XML 1.0]. The presence of 
this character sequence must generate a fatal error during serialization. See 
also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core Specification.
