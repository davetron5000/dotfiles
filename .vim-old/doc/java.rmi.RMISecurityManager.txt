*java.rmi.RMISecurityManager_Description*

A subclass of (|java.lang.SecurityManager|) used by RMI applications that use downloaded code. RMI's class loader will not download any classes from remote locations if no 
security manager has been set. RMISecurityManager does not apply to applets, which run under the protection of their browser's security manager. 

RMISecurityManager implements a policy that is no different than the policy implemented by (|java.lang.SecurityManager|) . Therefore an RMI application should use the 
SecurityManager class or another application-specific SecurityManager implementation instead of this class. 

To use a SecurityManager in your application, add the following statement to your code (it needs to be executed before RMI can download code from remote hosts, so it most likely 
needs to appear in the main method of your application): 



System.setSecurityManager(new SecurityManager()); 



*java.rmi.RMISecurityManager()*

public RMISecurityManager()

Constructs a new RMISecurityManager.
