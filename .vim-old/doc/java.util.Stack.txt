*java.util.Stack_Description*

The Stack class represents a last-in-first-out (LIFO) stack of objects. It extends class Vector with five operations that allow a vector to be treated as a stack. The usual push 
and pop operations are provided, as well as a method to peek at the top item on the stack, a method to test for whether the stack is empty, and a method to search the stack for an 
item and discover how far it is from the top. 

When a stack is first created, it contains no items. 



*java.util.Stack()*

public Stack()

Creates an empty Stack. 


*java.util.Stack.empty()*

public boolean empty()

Tests if this stack is empty. 



    Returns: true if and only if this stack contains no items; false otherwise. 

*java.util.Stack.peek()*

public synchronized |E| peek()

Looks at the object at the top of this stack without removing it from the stack. 



    Returns: the object at the top of this stack (the last item of the Vector object). 

*java.util.Stack.pop()*

public synchronized |E| pop()

Removes the object at the top of this stack and returns that object as the value of this function. 



    Returns: The object at the top of this stack (the last item of the Vector object). 

*java.util.Stack.push(E)*

public |E| push(E item)

Pushes an item onto the top of this stack. This has exactly the same effect as: 

addElement(item) 


    item - the item to be pushed onto this stack. 

    Returns: the item argument. 

*java.util.Stack.search(Object)*

public synchronized int search(java.lang.Object o)

Returns the 1-based position where an object is on this stack. If the object o occurs as an item in this stack, this method returns the distance from the top of the stack of the 
occurrence nearest the top of the stack; the topmost item on the stack is considered to be at distance 1. The equals method is used to compare o to the items in this stack. 


    o - the desired object. 

    Returns: the 1-based position from the top of the stack where the object is located; the return value -1 indicates that the object is not on the stack.
