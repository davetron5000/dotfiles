*java.awt.event.WindowListener_Description*

The listener interface for receiving window events. The class that is interested in processing a window event either implements this interface (and all the methods it contains) or 
extends the abstract WindowAdapter class (overriding only the methods of interest). The listener object created from that class is then registered with a Window using the window's 
addWindowListener method. When the window's status changes by virtue of being opened, closed, activated or deactivated, iconified or deiconified, the relevant method in the 
listener object is invoked, and the WindowEvent is passed to it. 



*java.awt.event.WindowListener.windowActivated(WindowEvent)*

public void windowActivated(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e)

Invoked when the Window is set to be the active Window. Only a Frame or a Dialog can be the active Window. The native windowing system may denote the active Window or its children 
with special decorations, such as a highlighted title bar. The active Window is always either the focused Window, or the first Frame or Dialog that is an owner of the focused 
Window. 



*java.awt.event.WindowListener.windowClosed(WindowEvent)*

public void windowClosed(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e)

Invoked when a window has been closed as the result of calling dispose on the window. 



*java.awt.event.WindowListener.windowClosing(WindowEvent)*

public void windowClosing(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e)

Invoked when the user attempts to close the window from the window's system menu. 



*java.awt.event.WindowListener.windowDeactivated(WindowEvent)*

public void windowDeactivated(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e)

Invoked when a Window is no longer the active Window. Only a Frame or a Dialog can be the active Window. The native windowing system may denote the active Window or its children 
with special decorations, such as a highlighted title bar. The active Window is always either the focused Window, or the first Frame or Dialog that is an owner of the focused 
Window. 



*java.awt.event.WindowListener.windowDeiconified(WindowEvent)*

public void windowDeiconified(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e)

Invoked when a window is changed from a minimized to a normal state. 



*java.awt.event.WindowListener.windowIconified(WindowEvent)*

public void windowIconified(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e)

Invoked when a window is changed from a normal to a minimized state. For many platforms, a minimized window is displayed as the icon specified in the window's iconImage property. 



*java.awt.event.WindowListener.windowOpened(WindowEvent)*

public void windowOpened(java.awt.event.WindowEvent e)

Invoked the first time a window is made visible.
