*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock_Description*

An implementation of (|java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock|) supporting similar semantics to (|java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock|) . This class has the following 
properties: 

Acquisition order 

This class does not impose a reader or writer preference ordering for lock access. However, it does support an optional fairness policy. When constructed as fair, threads contend 
for entry using an approximately arrival-order policy. When the write lock is released either the longest-waiting single writer will be assigned the write lock, or if there is a 
reader waiting longer than any writer, the set of readers will be assigned the read lock. When constructed as non-fair, the order of entry to the lock need not be in arrival 
order. In either case, if readers are active and a writer enters the lock then no subsequent readers will be granted the read lock until after that writer has acquired and 
released the write lock. 

Reentrancy This lock allows both readers and writers to reacquire read or write locks in the style of a (|java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock|) . Readers are not allowed 
until all write locks held by the writing thread have been released. Additionally, a writer can acquire the read lock - but not vice-versa. Among other applications, reentrancy 
can be useful when write locks are held during calls or callbacks to methods that perform reads under read locks. If a reader tries to acquire the write lock it will never 
succeed. 

Lock downgrading Reentrancy also allows downgrading from the write lock to a read lock, by acquiring the write lock, then the read lock and then releasing the write lock. However, 
upgrading from a read lock to the write lock is not possible. 

Interruption of lock acquisition The read lock and write lock both support interruption during lock acquisition. 

(|java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition|) support The write lock provides a (|java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition|) implementation that behaves in the same way, with respect to 
the write lock, as the (|java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition|) implementation provided by (|java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock|) does for 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantLock|) . This (|java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition|) can, of course, only be used with the write lock. The read lock does not support a 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition|) and readLock().newCondition() throws UnsupportedOperationException. 

Instrumentation This class supports methods to determine whether locks are held or contended. These methods are designed for monitoring system state, not for synchronization 
control. 

Serialization of this class behaves in the same way as built-in locks: a deserialized lock is in the unlocked state, regardless of its state when serialized. 

Sample usages. Here is a code sketch showing how to exploit reentrancy to perform lock downgrading after updating a cache (exception handling is elided for simplicity): 

class CachedData { Object data; volatile boolean cacheValid; ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock(); 

void processCachedData() { rwl.readLock().lock(); if (!cacheValid) { // upgrade lock manually rwl.readLock().unlock(); // must unlock first to obtain writelock 
rwl.writeLock().lock(); if (!cacheValid) { // recheck data = ... cacheValid = true; } // downgrade lock rwl.readLock().lock(); // reacquire read without giving up write lock 
rwl.writeLock().unlock(); // unlock write, still hold read } 

use(data); rwl.readLock().unlock(); } } 

ReentrantReadWriteLocks can be used to improve concurrency in some uses of some kinds of Collections. This is typically worthwhile only when the collections are expected to be 
large, accessed by more reader threads than writer threads, and entail operations with overhead that outweighs synchronization overhead. For example, here is a class using a 
TreeMap that is expected to be large and concurrently accessed. 



class RWDictionary { private final Map<String, Data> m = new TreeMap<String, Data>(); private final ReentrantReadWriteLock rwl = new ReentrantReadWriteLock(); private final Lock r 
= rwl.readLock(); private final Lock w = rwl.writeLock(); 

public Data get(String key) { r.lock(); try { return m.get(key); } finally { r.unlock(); } } public String[] allKeys() { r.lock(); try { return m.keySet().toArray(); } finally { 
r.unlock(); } } public Data put(String key, Data value) { w.lock(); try { return m.put(key, value); } finally { w.unlock(); } } public void clear() { w.lock(); try { m.clear(); } 
finally { w.unlock(); } } } 



Implementation Notes 

A reentrant write lock intrinsically defines an owner and can only be released by the thread that acquired it. In contrast, in this implementation, the read lock has no concept of 
ownership, and there is no requirement that the thread releasing a read lock is the same as the one that acquired it. However, this property is not guaranteed to hold in future 
implementations of this class. 

This lock supports a maximum of 65536 recursive write locks and 65536 read locks. Attempts to exceed these limits result in (|java.lang.Error|) throws from locking methods. 



*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock()*

public ReentrantReadWriteLock()

Creates a new ReentrantReadWriteLock with default ordering properties. 


*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock(boolean)*

public ReentrantReadWriteLock(boolean fair)

    fair - true if this lock should use a fair ordering policy 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getOwner()*

protected |java.lang.Thread| getOwner()

Returns the thread that currently owns the write lock, or null if not owned. Note that the owner may be momentarily null even if there are threads trying to acquire the lock but 
have not yet done so. This method is designed to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide more extensive lock monitoring facilities.

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getQueuedReaderThreads()*

protected |java.util.Collection|<Thread> getQueuedReaderThreads()

Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire the read lock. Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while constructing this result, the 
returned collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of 
subclasses that provide more extensive lock monitoring facilities. 



    Returns: the collection of threads 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getQueuedThreads()*

protected |java.util.Collection|<Thread> getQueuedThreads()

Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire either the read or write lock. Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically while constructing 
this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular order. This method is designed to facilitate 
construction of subclasses that provide more extensive monitoring facilities. 



    Returns: the collection of threads 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getQueuedWriterThreads()*

protected |java.util.Collection|<Thread> getQueuedWriterThreads()

returned collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular order. This method is designed to facilitate construction of 
subclasses that provide more extensive lock monitoring facilities. 



    Returns: the collection of threads 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getQueueLength()*

public final int getQueueLength()

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire either the read or write lock. The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may change dynamically 
while this method traverses internal data structures. This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system state, not for synchronization control. 



    Returns: the estimated number of threads waiting for this lock 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getReadLockCount()*

public int getReadLockCount()

Queries the number of read locks held for this lock. This method is designed for use in monitoring system state, not for synchronization control. 



    Returns: the number of read locks held. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getWaitingThreads(Condition)*

protected |java.util.Collection|<Thread> getWaitingThreads(java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition condition)

Returns a collection containing those threads that may be waiting on the given condition associated with the write lock. Because the actual set of threads may change dynamically 
while constructing this result, the returned collection is only a best-effort estimate. The elements of the returned collection are in no particular order. This method is designed 
to facilitate construction of subclasses that provide more extensive condition monitoring facilities. 


    condition - the condition 

    Returns: the collection of threads 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getWaitQueueLength(Condition)*

public int getWaitQueueLength(java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition condition)

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the given condition associated with the write lock. Note that because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the 
estimate serves only as an upper bound on the actual number of waiters. This method is designed for use in monitoring of the system state, not for synchronization control. 


    condition - the condition 

    Returns: the estimated number of waiting threads. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.getWriteHoldCount()*

public int getWriteHoldCount()

Queries the number of reentrant write holds on this lock by the current thread. A writer thread has a hold on a lock for each lock action that is not matched by an unlock action. 



    Returns: the number of holds on the write lock by the current thread, or zero if the write lock is not held by the current thread. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.hasQueuedThread(Thread)*

public final boolean hasQueuedThread(java.lang.Thread thread)

Queries whether the given thread is waiting to acquire either the read or write lock. Note that because cancellations may occur at any time, a true return does not guarantee that 
this thread will ever acquire a lock. This method is designed primarily for use in monitoring of the system state. 


    thread - the thread 

    Returns: true if the given thread is queued waiting for this lock. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.ReentrantReadWriteLock.hasQueuedThreads()*

not guarantee that a future signal will awaken any threads. This method is designed primarily for use in monitoring of the system state. 


    condition - the condition 

    Returns: true if there are any waiting threads.
