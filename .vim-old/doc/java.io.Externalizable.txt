*java.io.Externalizable_Description*

Only the identity of the class of an Externalizable instance is written in the serialization stream and it is the responsibility of the class to save and restore the contents of 
its instances. 

The writeExternal and readExternal methods of the Externalizable interface are implemented by a class to give the class complete control over the format and contents of the stream 
for an object and its supertypes. These methods must explicitly coordinate with the supertype to save its state. These methods supersede customized implementations of writeObject 
and readObject methods. 

Object Serialization uses the Serializable and Externalizable interfaces. Object persistence mechanisms can use them as well. Each object to be stored is tested for the 
Externalizable interface. If the object supports Externalizable, the writeExternal method is called. If the object does not support Externalizable and does implement Serializable, 
the object is saved using ObjectOutputStream. When an Externalizable object is reconstructed, an instance is created using the public no-arg constructor, then the readExternal 
method called. Serializable objects are restored by reading them from an ObjectInputStream. 

An Externalizable instance can designate a substitution object via the writeReplace and readResolve methods documented in the Serializable interface. 



*java.io.Externalizable.readExternal(ObjectInput)*

public void readExternal(java.io.ObjectInput in)
  throws |java.lang.ClassNotFoundException|
         |java.io.IOException|
         
The object implements the readExternal method to restore its contents by calling the methods of DataInput for primitive types and readObject for objects, strings and arrays. The 
readExternal method must read the values in the same sequence and with the same types as were written by writeExternal. 


    in - the stream to read data from in order to restore the object 

*java.io.Externalizable.writeExternal(ObjectOutput)*

public void writeExternal(java.io.ObjectOutput out)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
The object implements the writeExternal method to save its contents by calling the methods of DataOutput for its primitive values or calling the writeObject method of ObjectOutput 
for objects, strings, and arrays. 


    out - the stream to write the object to
