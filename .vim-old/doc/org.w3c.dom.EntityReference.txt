*org.w3c.dom.EntityReference_Description*

EntityReference nodes may be used to represent an entity reference in the tree. 
Note that character references and references to predefined entities are 
considered to be expanded by the HTML or XML processor so that characters are 
represented by their Unicode equivalent rather than by an entity reference. 
Moreover, the XML processor may completely expand references to entities while 
building the Document, instead of providing EntityReference nodes. If it does 
provide such nodes, then for an EntityReference node that represents a 
reference to a known entity an Entity exists, and the subtree of the 
EntityReference node is a copy of the Entity node subtree. However, the latter 
may not be true when an entity contains an unbound namespace prefix. In such a 
case, because the namespace prefix resolution depends on where the entity 
reference is, the descendants of the EntityReference node may be bound to 
different namespace URIs. When an EntityReference node represents a reference 
to an unknown entity, the node has no children and its replacement value, when 
used by Attr.value for example, is empty. As for Entity nodes, EntityReference 
nodes and all their descendants are readonly. Note: EntityReference nodes may 
cause element content and attribute value normalization problems when, such as 
in XML 1.0 and XML Schema, the normalization is performed after entity 
reference are expanded. See also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 3 Core 
Specification.
