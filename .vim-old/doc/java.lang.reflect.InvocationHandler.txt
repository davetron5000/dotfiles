*java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler_Description*

InvocationHandler is the interface implemented by the invocation handler of a proxy instance. 

Each proxy instance has an associated invocation handler. When a method is invoked on a proxy instance, the method invocation is encoded and dispatched to the invoke method of its 
invocation handler. 



*java.lang.reflect.InvocationHandler.invoke(Object,Method,Object[])*

public |java.lang.Object| invoke(
  java.lang.Object proxy,
  java.lang.reflect.Method method,
  java.lang.Object[] args)
  throws |java.lang.Throwable|
         
Processes a method invocation on a proxy instance and returns the result. This method will be invoked on an invocation handler when a method is invoked on a proxy instance that it 
is associated with. 


    proxy - the proxy instance that the method was invoked on 
    method - the Method instance corresponding to the interface method invoked on the proxy instance. The declaring class of the Method object will be the interface that the method was 
       declared in, which may be a superinterface of the proxy interface that the proxy class inherits the method through. 
    args - an array of objects containing the values of the arguments passed in the method invocation on the proxy instance, or null if interface method takes no arguments. Arguments of 
       primitive types are wrapped in instances of the appropriate primitive wrapper class, such as java.lang.Integer or java.lang.Boolean. 

    Returns: the value to return from the method invocation on the proxy instance. If the declared return type of the interface method is a primitive type, then the value returned by this 
             method must be an instance of the corresponding primitive wrapper class; otherwise, it must be a type assignable to the declared return type. If the value returned by 
             this method is null and the interface method's return type is primitive, then a NullPointerException will be thrown by the method invocation on the proxy instance. If 
             the value returned by this method is otherwise not compatible with the interface method's declared return type as described above, a ClassCastException will be thrown 
             by the method invocation on the proxy instance.
