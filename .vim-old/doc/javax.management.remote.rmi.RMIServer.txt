*javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIServer_Description*

RMI object used to establish connections to an RMI connector. There is one 
Remote object implementing this interface for each RMI connector. 

User code does not usually refer to this interface. It is specified as part of 
the public API so that different implementations of that API will interoperate. 


*javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIServer.getVersion()*

public |java.lang.String| getVersion()
  throws |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         
The version of the RMI Connector Protocol understood by this connector server. 
This is a string with the following format: 



protocol-version implementation-name 

The protocol-version is a series of two or more non-negative integers separated 
by periods (.). An implementation of the version described by this 
documentation must use the string 1.0 here. 

After the protocol version there must be a space, followed by the 
implementation name. The format of the implementation name is unspecified. It 
is recommended that it include an implementation version number. An 
implementation can use an empty string as its implementation name, for example 
for security reasons. 


    Returns: a string with the format described here. 
*javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIServer.newClient(Object)*

public |javax.management.remote.rmi.RMIConnection| newClient(java.lang.Object credentials)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Makes a new connection through this RMI connector. Each remote client calls 
this method to obtain a new RMI object representing its connection. 

    credentials - this object specifies the user-defined credentials to be passed in to the 
       server in order to authenticate the user before creating the 
       RMIConnection. Can be null. 

    Returns: the newly-created connection object.
