*java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo_Description*

The GlyphJustificationInfo class represents information about the justification properties of a glyph. A glyph is the visual representation of one or more characters. Many 
different glyphs can be used to represent a single character or combination of characters. The four justification properties represented by GlyphJustificationInfo are weight, 
priority, absorb and limit. 

Weight is the overall 'weight' of the glyph in the line. Generally it is proportional to the size of the font. Glyphs with larger weight are allocated a correspondingly larger 
amount of the change in space. 

Priority determines the justification phase in which this glyph is used. All glyphs of the same priority are examined before glyphs of the next priority. If all the change in 
space can be allocated to these glyphs without exceeding their limits, then glyphs of the next priority are not examined. There are four priorities, kashida, whitespace, 
interchar, and none. KASHIDA is the first priority examined. NONE is the last priority examined. 

Absorb determines whether a glyph absorbs all change in space. Within a given priority, some glyphs may absorb all the change in space. If any of these glyphs are present, no 
glyphs of later priority are examined. 

Limit determines the maximum or minimum amount by which the glyph can change. Left and right sides of the glyph can have different limits. 

Each GlyphJustificationInfo represents two sets of metrics, which are growing and shrinking. Growing metrics are used when the glyphs on a line are to be spread apart to fit a 
larger width. Shrinking metrics are used when the glyphs are to be moved together to fit a smaller width. 



*boolean_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.growAbsorb*

If true, this glyph absorbs all extra space at this and lower priority levels when it grows. 


*float_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.growLeftLimit*

The maximum amount by which the left side of this glyph can grow. 


*int_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.growPriority*

The priority level of this glyph as it is growing. 


*float_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.growRightLimit*

The maximum amount by which the right side of this glyph can grow. 


*int_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.PRIORITY_INTERCHAR*

The second lowest justification priority. 


*int_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.PRIORITY_KASHIDA*

The highest justification priority. 


*int_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.PRIORITY_NONE*

The lowest justification priority. 


*int_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.PRIORITY_WHITESPACE*

The second highest justification priority. 


*boolean_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.shrinkAbsorb*

If true,this glyph absorbs all remaining shrinkage at this and lower priority levels as it shrinks. 


*float_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.shrinkLeftLimit*

The maximum amount by which the left side of this glyph can shrink (a positive number). 


*int_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.shrinkPriority*

The priority level of this glyph as it is shrinking. 


*float_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.shrinkRightLimit*

The maximum amount by which the right side of this glyph can shrink (a positive number). 


*float_java.awt.font.GlyphJustificationInfo.weight*

The weight of this glyph.
