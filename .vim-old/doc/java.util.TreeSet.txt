*java.util.TreeSet_Description*

This class implements the Set interface, backed by a TreeMap instance. This class guarantees that the sorted set will be in ascending element order, sorted according to the 
natural order of the elements (see Comparable), or by the comparator provided at set creation time, depending on which constructor is used. 

This implementation provides guaranteed log(n) time cost for the basic operations (add, remove and contains). 

Note that the ordering maintained by a set (whether or not an explicit comparator is provided) must be consistent with equals if it is to correctly implement the Set interface. 
(See Comparable or Comparator for a precise definition of consistent with equals.) This is so because the Set interface is defined in terms of the equals operation, but a TreeSet 
instance performs all key comparisons using its compareTo (or compare) method, so two keys that are deemed equal by this method are, from the standpoint of the set, equal. The 
behavior of a set is well-defined even if its ordering is inconsistent with equals; it just fails to obey the general contract of the Set interface. 

Note that this implementation is not synchronized. If multiple threads access a set concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the set, it must be synchronized 
externally. This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the set. If no such object exists, the set should be "wrapped" using the 
Collections.synchronizedSet method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the set: 

SortedSet s = Collections.synchronizedSortedSet(new TreeSet(...)); 

The Iterators returned by this class's iterator method are fail-fast: if the set is modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any way except through the iterator's 
own remove method, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than 
risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future. 

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized 
concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this 
exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs. 

This class is a member of the <a href="/../guide/collections/index.html"> Java Collections Framework. 



*java.util.TreeSet()*

public TreeSet()

Constructs a new, empty set, sorted according to the elements' natural order. All elements inserted into the set must implement the Comparable interface. Furthermore, all such 
elements must be mutually comparable: e1.compareTo(e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the set. If the user attempts to add an element to the set 
that violates this constraint (for example, the user attempts to add a string element to a set whose elements are integers), the add(Object) call will throw a ClassCastException. 


*java.util.TreeSet(Collection<?extendsE>)*

public TreeSet(java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Constructs a new set containing the elements in the specified collection, sorted according to the elements' natural order. All keys inserted into the set must implement the 
Comparable interface. Furthermore, all such keys must be mutually comparable: k1.compareTo(k2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements k1 and k2 in the set. 

    c - The elements that will comprise the new set. 

*java.util.TreeSet(Comparator<?superE>)*

public TreeSet(java.util.Comparator<? super E> c)

Constructs a new, empty set, sorted according to the specified comparator. All elements inserted into the set must be mutually comparable by the specified comparator: 
comparator.compare(e1, e2) must not throw a ClassCastException for any elements e1 and e2 in the set. If the user attempts to add an element to the set that violates this 
constraint, the add(Object) call will throw a ClassCastException. 

    c - the comparator that will be used to sort this set. A null value indicates that the elements' natural ordering should be used. 

*java.util.TreeSet(SortedSet<E>)*

public TreeSet(java.util.SortedSet<E> s)

Constructs a new set containing the same elements as the specified sorted set, sorted according to the same ordering. 

    s - sorted set whose elements will comprise the new set. 

*java.util.TreeSet.add(E)*

public boolean add(E o)

Adds the specified element to this set if it is not already present. 


    o - element to be added to this set. 

    Returns: true if the set did not already contain the specified element. 

*java.util.TreeSet.addAll(Collection<?extendsE>)*

public boolean addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Adds all of the elements in the specified collection to this set. 


    c - elements to be added 

    Returns: true if this set changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.TreeSet.clear()*

public void clear()

Removes all of the elements from this set. 



*java.util.TreeSet.clone()*

public |java.lang.Object| clone()

Returns a shallow copy of this TreeSet instance. (The elements themselves are not cloned.) 



    Returns: a shallow copy of this set. 

*java.util.TreeSet.comparator()*

public |java.util.Comparator|<? super E> comparator()

Returns the comparator used to order this sorted set, or null if this tree set uses its elements natural ordering. 



    Returns: the comparator used to order this sorted set, or null if this tree set uses its elements natural ordering. 

*java.util.TreeSet.contains(Object)*

public boolean contains(java.lang.Object o)

Returns true if this set contains the specified element. 


    o - the object to be checked for containment in this set. 

    Returns: true if this set contains the specified element. 

*java.util.TreeSet.first()*

public |E| first()

Returns the first (lowest) element currently in this sorted set. 



    Returns: the first (lowest) element currently in this sorted set. 

*java.util.TreeSet.headSet(E)*

public |java.util.SortedSet|<E> headSet(E toElement)

Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are strictly less than toElement. The returned sorted set is backed by this set, so changes in the returned sorted set are 
reflected in this set, and vice-versa. The returned sorted set supports all optional set operations. 

The sorted set returned by this method will throw an IllegalArgumentException if the user attempts to insert an element greater than or equal to toElement. 

Note: this method always returns a view that does not contain its (high) endpoint. If you need a view that does contain this endpoint, and the element type allows for calculation 
of the successor of a specified value, merely request a headSet bounded by successor(highEndpoint). For example, suppose that s is a sorted set of strings. The following idiom 
obtains a view containing all of the strings in s that are less than or equal to high: SortedSet head = s.headSet(high+"\0"); 


    toElement - high endpoint (exclusive) of the headSet. 

    Returns: a view of the portion of this set whose elements are strictly less than toElement. 

*java.util.TreeSet.isEmpty()*

public boolean isEmpty()

Returns true if this set contains no elements. 



    Returns: true if this set contains no elements. 

*java.util.TreeSet.iterator()*

public |java.util.Iterator|<E> iterator()

Returns an iterator over the elements in this set. The elements are returned in ascending order. 



    Returns: an iterator over the elements in this set. 

*java.util.TreeSet.last()*

public |E| last()

Returns the last (highest) element currently in this sorted set. 



    Returns: the last (highest) element currently in this sorted set. 

*java.util.TreeSet.remove(Object)*

public boolean remove(java.lang.Object o)

Removes the specified element from this set if it is present. 


    o - object to be removed from this set, if present. 

    Returns: true if the set contained the specified element. 

*java.util.TreeSet.size()*

public int size()

Returns the number of elements in this set (its cardinality). 



    Returns: the number of elements in this set (its cardinality). 

*java.util.TreeSet.subSet(E,E)*

public |java.util.SortedSet|<E> subSet(
  E fromElement,
  E toElement)

Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements range from fromElement, inclusive, to toElement, exclusive. (If fromElement and toElement are equal, the returned sorted 
set is empty.) The returned sorted set is backed by this set, so changes in the returned sorted set are reflected in this set, and vice-versa. The returned sorted set supports all 
optional Set operations. 

The sorted set returned by this method will throw an IllegalArgumentException if the user attempts to insert an element outside the specified range. 

Note: this method always returns a half-open range (which includes its low endpoint but not its high endpoint). If you need a closed range (which includes both endpoints), and the 
element type allows for calculation of the successor of a specified value, merely request the subrange from lowEndpoint to successor(highEndpoint). For example, suppose that s is 
a sorted set of strings. The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the strings in s from low to high, inclusive: 

SortedSet sub = s.subSet(low, high+"\0"); 

A similar technique can be used to generate an open range (which contains neither endpoint). The following idiom obtains a view containing all of the strings in s from low to 
high, exclusive: 

SortedSet sub = s.subSet(low+"\0", high); 


    fromElement - low endpoint (inclusive) of the subSet. 
    toElement - high endpoint (exclusive) of the subSet. 

    Returns: a view of the portion of this set whose elements range from fromElement, inclusive, to toElement, exclusive. 

*java.util.TreeSet.tailSet(E)*

public |java.util.SortedSet|<E> tailSet(E fromElement)

Returns a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement. The returned sorted set is backed by this set, so changes in the returned sorted 
set are reflected in this set, and vice-versa. The returned sorted set supports all optional set operations. 

The sorted set returned by this method will throw an IllegalArgumentException if the user attempts to insert an element less than fromElement. 

Note: this method always returns a view that contains its (low) endpoint. If you need a view that does not contain this endpoint, and the element type allows for calculation of 
the successor of a specified value, merely request a tailSet bounded by successor(lowEndpoint). For example, suppose that s is a sorted set of strings. The following idiom obtains 
a view containing all of the strings in s that are strictly greater than low: 

SortedSet tail = s.tailSet(low+"\0"); 


    fromElement - low endpoint (inclusive) of the tailSet. 

    Returns: a view of the portion of this set whose elements are greater than or equal to fromElement.
