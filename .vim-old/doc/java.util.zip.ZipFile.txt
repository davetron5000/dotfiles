*java.util.zip.ZipFile_Description*

This class is used to read entries from a zip file. 

Unless otherwise noted, passing a null argument to a constructor or method in this class will cause a (|java.lang.NullPointerException|) to be thrown. 



*int_java.util.zip.ZipFile.OPEN_DELETE*

Mode flag to open a zip file and mark it for deletion. The file will be deleted some time between the moment that it is opened and the moment that it is closed, but its contents 
will remain accessible via the ZipFile object until either the close method is invoked or the virtual machine exits. 


*int_java.util.zip.ZipFile.OPEN_READ*

Mode flag to open a zip file for reading. 



*java.util.zip.ZipFile(File)*

public ZipFile(java.io.File file)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         |java.util.zip.ZipException|
         
Opens a ZIP file for reading given the specified File object. 

    file - the ZIP file to be opened for reading 

*java.util.zip.ZipFile(File,int)*

public ZipFile(
  java.io.File file,
  int mode)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Opens a new ZipFile to read from the specified File object in the specified mode. The mode argument must be either OPEN_READ or OPEN_READ | OPEN_DELETE. 

First, if there is a security manager, its checkRead method is called with the name argument as its argument to ensure the read is allowed. 

    file - the ZIP file to be opened for reading 
    mode - the mode in which the file is to be opened 

*java.util.zip.ZipFile(String)*

public ZipFile(java.lang.String name)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Opens a zip file for reading. 

First, if there is a security manager, its checkRead method is called with the name argument as its argument to ensure the read is allowed. 

    name - the name of the zip file 

*java.util.zip.ZipFile.close()*

public void close()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Closes the ZIP file. Closing this ZIP file will close all of the input streams previously returned by invocations of the getInputStream(|java.util.zip.ZipFile|) method. 



*java.util.zip.ZipFile.entries()*

public |java.util.Enumeration|<? extends java.util.zip.ZipEntry> entries()

Returns an enumeration of the ZIP file entries. 



    Returns: an enumeration of the ZIP file entries 

*java.util.zip.ZipFile.finalize()*

protected void finalize()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Ensures that the close method of this ZIP file is called when there are no more references to it. 

Since the time when GC would invoke this method is undetermined, it is strongly recommended that applications invoke the close method as soon they have finished accessing this 
ZipFile. This will prevent holding up system resources for an undetermined length of time. 



*java.util.zip.ZipFile.getEntry(String)*

public |java.util.zip.ZipEntry| getEntry(java.lang.String name)

Returns the zip file entry for the specified name, or null if not found. 


    name - the name of the entry 

    Returns: the zip file entry, or null if not found 

*java.util.zip.ZipFile.getInputStream(ZipEntry)*

public |java.io.InputStream| getInputStream(java.util.zip.ZipEntry entry)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Returns an input stream for reading the contents of the specified zip file entry. 

Returns an input stream for reading the contents of the specified zip file entry. 

Closing this ZIP file will, in turn, close all input streams that have been returned by invocations of this method. 


    entry - the zip file entry 

    Returns: the input stream for reading the contents of the specified zip file entry. 

*java.util.zip.ZipFile.getName()*

public |java.lang.String| getName()

Returns the path name of the ZIP file. 



    Returns: the path name of the ZIP file 

*java.util.zip.ZipFile.size()*

public int size()

Returns the number of entries in the ZIP file. 



    Returns: the number of entries in the ZIP file
