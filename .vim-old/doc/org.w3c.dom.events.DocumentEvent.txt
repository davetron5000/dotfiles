*org.w3c.dom.events.DocumentEvent_Description*

The DocumentEvent interface provides a mechanism by which the user can create 
an Event of a type supported by the implementation. It is expected that the 
DocumentEvent interface will be implemented on the same object which implements 
the Document interface in an implementation which supports the Event model. See 
also the Document Object Model (DOM) Level 2 Events Specification. 


*org.w3c.dom.events.DocumentEvent.createEvent(String)*

public |org.w3c.dom.events.Event| createEvent(java.lang.String eventType)
  throws |org.w3c.dom.DOMException|
         


    eventTypeThe - eventType parameter specifies the type of Event interface to be created. If the 
       Event interface specified is supported by the implementation this method 
       will return a new Event of the interface type requested. If the Event is 
       to be dispatched via the dispatchEvent method the appropriate event init 
       method must be called after creation in order to initialize the Event's 
       values. As an example, a user wishing to synthesize some kind of UIEvent 
       would call createEvent with the parameter "UIEvents". The initUIEvent 
       method could then be called on the newly created UIEvent to set the 
       specific type of UIEvent to be dispatched and set its context 
       information.The createEvent method is used in creating Events when it is 
       either inconvenient or unnecessary for the user to create an Event 
       themselves. In cases where the implementation provided Event is 
       insufficient, users may supply their own Event implementations for use 
       with the dispatchEvent method. 

    Returns: The newly created Event
