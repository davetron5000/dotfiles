*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer_Description*

Provides a framework for implementing blocking locks and related synchronizers (semaphores, events, etc) that rely on first-in-first-out (FIFO) wait queues. This class is designed 
to be a useful basis for most kinds of synchronizers that rely on a single atomic int value to represent state. Subclasses must define the protected methods that change this 
state, and which define what that state means in terms of this object being acquired or released. Given these, the other methods in this class carry out all queuing and blocking 
mechanics. Subclasses can maintain other state fields, but only the atomically updated int value manipulated using methods 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) , (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) and (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) 
is tracked with respect to synchronization. 

Subclasses should be defined as non-public internal helper classes that are used to implement the synchronization properties of their enclosing class. Class 
AbstractQueuedSynchronizer does not implement any synchronization interface. Instead it defines methods such as (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) that can 
be invoked as appropriate by concrete locks and related synchronizers to implement their public methods. 

This class supports either or both a default exclusive mode and a shared mode. When acquired in exclusive mode, attempted acquires by other threads cannot succeed. Shared mode 
acquires by multiple threads may (but need not) succeed. This class does not understand these differences except in the mechanical sense that when a shared mode acquire succeeds, 
the next waiting thread (if one exists) must also determine whether it can acquire as well. Threads waiting in the different modes share the same FIFO queue. Usually, 
implementation subclasses support only one of these modes, but both can come into play for example in a (|java.util.concurrent.locks.ReadWriteLock|) . Subclasses that support only 
exclusive or only shared modes need not define the methods supporting the unused mode. 

This class defines a nested (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject|) class that can be used as a (|java.util.concurrent.locks.Condition|) 
implementation by subclasses supporting exclusive mode for which method (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) reports whether synchronization is exclusively 
held with respect to the current thread, method (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) invoked with the current 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) value fully releases this object, and (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) , given this saved state 
value, eventually restores this object to its previous acquired state. No AbstractQueuedSynchronizer method otherwise creates such a condition, so if this constraint cannot be 
met, do not use it. The behavior of (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject|) depends of course on the semantics of its synchronizer 
implementation. 

This class provides inspection, instrumentation, and monitoring methods for the internal queue, as well as similar methods for condition objects. These can be exported as desired 
into classes using an AbstractQueuedSynchronizer for their synchronization mechanics. 

Serialization of this class stores only the underlying atomic integer maintaining state, so deserialized objects have empty thread queues. Typical subclasses requiring 
serializability will define a readObject method that restores this to a known initial state upon deserialization. 

Usage 

To use this class as the basis of a synchronizer, redefine the following methods, as applicable, by inspecting and/or modifying the synchronization state using 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) , (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) and/or 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) : 

(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) 

Each of these methods by default throws (|java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException|) . Implementations of these methods must be internally thread-safe, and should in general be 
short and not block. Defining these methods is the only supported means of using this class. All other methods are declared final because they cannot be independently varied. 

Even though this class is based on an internal FIFO queue, it does not automatically enforce FIFO acquisition policies. The core of exclusive synchronization takes the form: 



Acquire: while (!tryAcquire(arg)) { enqueue thread if it is not already queued; possibly block current thread; } 

Release: if (tryRelease(arg)) unblock the first queued thread; 

(Shared mode is similar but may involve cascading signals.) 

Because checks in acquire are invoked before enqueuing, a newly acquiring thread may barge ahead of others that are blocked and queued. However, you can, if desired, define 
tryAcquire and/or tryAcquireShared to disable barging by internally invoking one or more of the inspection methods. In particular, a strict FIFO lock can define tryAcquire to 
immediately return false if (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) does not return the current thread. A normally preferable non-strict fair version can 
immediately return false only if (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) returns true and getFirstQueuedThread is not the current thread; or equivalently, that 
getFirstQueuedThread is both non-null and not the current thread. Further variations are possible. 

Throughput and scalability are generally highest for the default barging (also known as greedy, renouncement, and convoy-avoidance) strategy. While this is not guaranteed to be 
fair or starvation-free, earlier queued threads are allowed to recontend before later queued threads, and each recontention has an unbiased chance to succeed against incoming 
threads. Also, while acquires do not spin in the usual sense, they may perform multiple invocations of tryAcquire interspersed with other computations before blocking. This gives 
most of the benefits of spins when exclusive synchronization is only briefly held, without most of the liabilities when it isn't. If so desired, you can augment this by preceding 
calls to acquire methods with "fast-path" checks, possibly prechecking (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) and/or 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) to only do so if the synchronizer is likely not to be contended. 

This class provides an efficient and scalable basis for synchronization in part by specializing its range of use to synchronizers that can rely on int state, acquire, and release 
parameters, and an internal FIFO wait queue. When this does not suffice, you can build synchronizers from a lower level using atomic(|java.util.concurrent.atomic|) classes, your 
own custom (|java.util.Queue|) classes, and (|java.util.concurrent.locks.LockSupport|) blocking support. 

Usage Examples 

Here is a non-reentrant mutual exclusion lock class that uses the value zero to represent the unlocked state, and one to represent the locked state. It also supports conditions 
and exposes one of the instrumentation methods: 



class Mutex implements Lock, java.io.Serializable { 

// Our internal helper class private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer { // Report whether in locked state protected boolean isHeldExclusively() { return 
getState() == 1; } 

// Acquire the lock if state is zero public boolean tryAcquire(int acquires) { assert acquires == 1; // Otherwise unused return compareAndSetState(0, 1); } 

// Release the lock by setting state to zero protected boolean tryRelease(int releases) { assert releases == 1; // Otherwise unused if (getState() == 0) throw new 
IllegalMonitorStateException(); setState(0); return true; } 

// Provide a Condition Condition newCondition() { return new ConditionObject(); } 

// Deserialize properly private void readObject(ObjectInputStream s) throws IOException, ClassNotFoundException { s.defaultReadObject(); setState(0); // reset to unlocked state } 
} 

// The sync object does all the hard work. We just forward to it. private final Sync sync = new Sync(); 

public void lock() { sync.acquire(1); } public boolean tryLock() { return sync.tryAcquire(1); } public void unlock() { sync.release(1); } public Condition newCondition() { return 
sync.newCondition(); } public boolean isLocked() { return sync.isHeldExclusively(); } public boolean hasQueuedThreads() { return sync.hasQueuedThreads(); } public void 
lockInterruptibly() throws InterruptedException { sync.acquireInterruptibly(1); } public boolean tryLock(long timeout, TimeUnit unit) throws InterruptedException { return 
sync.tryAcquireNanos(1, unit.toNanos(timeout)); } } 

Here is a latch class that is like a (|java.util.concurrent.CountDownLatch|) except that it only requires a single signal to fire. Because a latch is non-exclusive, it uses the 
shared acquire and release methods. 



class BooleanLatch { 

private static class Sync extends AbstractQueuedSynchronizer { boolean isSignalled() { return getState() != 0; } 

protected int tryAcquireShared(int ignore) { return isSignalled()? 1 : -1; } 

protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int ignore) { setState(1); return true; } } 

private final Sync sync = new Sync(); public boolean isSignalled() { return sync.isSignalled(); } public void signal() { sync.releaseShared(1); } public void await() throws 
InterruptedException { sync.acquireSharedInterruptibly(1); } }

public final |java.util.Collection|<Thread> getExclusiveQueuedThreads()

Returns a collection containing threads that may be waiting to acquire in exclusive mode. This has the same properties as (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|)

public final |java.lang.Thread| getFirstQueuedThread()

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.getQueuedThreads()*

public final |java.util.Collection|<Thread> getQueuedThreads()

that provide more extensive monitoring facilities. 



    Returns: the collection of threads 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.getQueueLength()*

public final int getQueueLength()

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting to acquire. The value is only an estimate because the number of threads may change dynamically while this method traverses 
internal data structures. This method is designed for use in monitoring system state, not for synchronization control.

public final |java.util.Collection|<Thread> getWaitingThreads(java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject condition)

Returns a collection containing those threads that may be waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer. Because the actual set of threads may change

public final int getWaitQueueLength(java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject condition)

Returns an estimate of the number of threads waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer. Note that because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, the

    Returns: the estimated number of waiting threads. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.hasContended()*

    Returns: true if there has ever been contention 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.hasQueuedThreads()*

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.hasWaiters(AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject)*

public final boolean hasWaiters(java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject condition)

Queries whether any threads are waiting on the given condition associated with this synchronizer. Note that because timeouts and interrupts may occur at any time, a true return 
does not guarantee that a future signal will awaken any threads. This method is designed primarily for use in monitoring of the system state. 


    condition - the condition 

    Returns: true if there are any waiting threads. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.isHeldExclusively()*

protected boolean isHeldExclusively()

Returns true if synchronization is held exclusively with respect to the current (calling) thread. This method is invoked upon each call to a non-waiting 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject|) method. (Waiting methods instead invoke (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) .) The 
default implementation throws (|java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException|) . This method is invoked internally only within 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.ConditionObject|) methods, so need not be defined if conditions are not used.

    Returns: the value returned from {@link #tryRelease} 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.releaseShared(int)*

public final boolean releaseShared(int arg)

Releases in shared mode. Implemented by unblocking one or more threads if (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) returns true.

Sets the value of synchronization state. This operation has memory semantics of a volatile write. 


    newState - the new state value 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.toString()*

public |java.lang.String| toString()

Returns a string identifying this synchronizer, as well as its state. The state, in brackets, includes the String State = followed by the current value of 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) , and either nonempty or empty depending on whether the queue is empty. 



    Returns: a string identifying this synchronizer, as well as its state. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.tryAcquire(int)*

protected boolean tryAcquire(int arg)

Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode. This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the exclusive mode, and if so to acquire it. 

This method is always invoked by the thread performing acquire. If this method reports failure, the acquire method may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is 
signalled by a release from some other thread. This can be used to implement method (|java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock|) . 

The default implementation throws (|java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException|) 


    arg - the acquire argument. This value is always the one passed to an acquire method, or is the value saved on entry to a condition wait. The value is otherwise uninterpreted and can 
       represent anything you like. 

    Returns: true if successful. Upon success, this object has been acquired. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.tryAcquireNanos(int,long)*

public final boolean tryAcquireNanos(
  int arg,
  long nanosTimeout)
  throws |java.lang.InterruptedException|
         
Attempts to acquire in exclusive mode, aborting if interrupted, and failing if the given timeout elapses. Implemented by first checking interrupt status, then invoking at least 
once (|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) , returning on success. Otherwise, the thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) until success or the thread is interrupted or the timeout elapses. This method can be used to implement method 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.Lock|) . 


    arg - the acquire argument. This value is conveyed to {@link #tryAcquire} but is otherwise uninterpreted and can represent anything you like. 
    nanosTimeout - the maximum number of nanoseconds to wait 

    Returns: true if acquired; false if timed out 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.tryAcquireShared(int)*

protected int tryAcquireShared(int arg)

Attempts to acquire in shared mode. This method should query if the state of the object permits it to be acquired in the shared mode, and if so to acquire it. 

This method is always invoked by the thread performing acquire. If this method reports failure, the acquire method may queue the thread, if it is not already queued, until it is 
signalled by a release from some other thread. 

The default implementation throws (|java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException|) 


    arg - the acquire argument. This value is always the one passed to an acquire method, or is the value saved on entry to a condition wait. The value is otherwise uninterpreted and can 
       represent anything you like. 

    Returns: a negative value on failure, zero on exclusive success, and a positive value if non-exclusively successful, in which case a subsequent waiting thread must check availability. 
             (Support for three different return values enables this method to be used in contexts where acquires only sometimes act exclusively.) Upon success, this object has 
             been acquired. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.tryAcquireSharedNanos(int,long)*

public final boolean tryAcquireSharedNanos(
  int arg,
  long nanosTimeout)
  throws |java.lang.InterruptedException|
         
Attempts to acquire in shared mode, aborting if interrupted, and failing if the given timeout elapses. Implemented by first checking interrupt status, then invoking at least once 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) , returning on success. Otherwise, the thread is queued, possibly repeatedly blocking and unblocking, invoking 
(|java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer|) until success or the thread is interrupted or the timeout elapses. 


    arg - the acquire argument. This value is conveyed to {@link #tryAcquireShared} but is otherwise uninterpreted and can represent anything you like. 
    nanosTimeout - the maximum number of nanoseconds to wait 

    Returns: true if acquired; false if timed out 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.tryRelease(int)*

protected boolean tryRelease(int arg)

Attempts to set the state to reflect a release in exclusive mode. This method is always invoked by the thread performing release. 

The default implementation throws (|java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException|) 


    arg - the release argument. This value is always the one passed to a release method, or the current state value upon entry to a condition wait. The value is otherwise uninterpreted and 
       can represent anything you like. 

    Returns: true if this object is now in a fully released state, so that any waiting threads may attempt to acquire; and false otherwise. 

*java.util.concurrent.locks.AbstractQueuedSynchronizer.tryReleaseShared(int)*

protected boolean tryReleaseShared(int arg)

Attempts to set the state to reflect a release in shared mode. This method is always invoked by the thread performing release. The default implementation throws 
(|java.lang.UnsupportedOperationException|)

       can represent anything you like. 

    Returns: true if this object is now in a fully released state, so that any waiting threads may attempt to acquire; and false otherwise.
