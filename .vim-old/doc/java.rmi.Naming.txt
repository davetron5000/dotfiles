*java.rmi.Naming_Description*

The Naming class provides methods for storing and obtaining references to remote objects in a remote object registry. Each method of the Naming class takes as one of its arguments 
a name that is a java.lang.String in URL format (without the scheme component) of the form: 



//host:port/name 

where host is the host (remote or local) where the registry is located, port is the port number on which the registry accepts calls, and where name is a simple string 
uninterpreted by the registry. Both host and port are optional. If host is omitted, the host defaults to the local host. If port is omitted, then the port defaults to 1099, the 
"well-known" port that RMI's registry, rmiregistry, uses. 

Binding a name for a remote object is associating or registering a name for a remote object that can be used at a later time to look up that remote object. A remote object can be 
associated with a name using the Naming class's bind or rebind methods. 

Once a remote object is registered (bound) with the RMI registry on the local host, callers on a remote (or local) host can lookup the remote object by name, obtain its reference, 
and then invoke remote methods on the object. A registry may be shared by all servers running on a host or an individual server process may create and use its own registry if 
desired (see java.rmi.registry.LocateRegistry.createRegistry method for details). 



*java.rmi.Naming.bind(String,Remote)*

public static void bind(
  java.lang.String name,
  java.rmi.Remote obj)
  throws |java.rmi.AlreadyBoundException|
         |java.net.MalformedURLException|
         |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         
Binds the specified name to a remote object. 


    name - a name in URL format (without the scheme component) 
    obj - a reference for the remote object (usually a stub) 

*java.rmi.Naming.list(String)*

public static |java.lang.String|[] list(java.lang.String name)
  throws |java.net.MalformedURLException|
         |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         
Returns an array of the names bound in the registry. The names are URL-formatted (without the scheme component) strings. The array contains a snapshot of the names present in the 
registry at the time of the call. 


    name - a registry name in URL format (without the scheme component) 

    Returns: an array of names (in the appropriate format) bound in the registry 

*java.rmi.Naming.lookup(String)*

public static |java.rmi.Remote| lookup(java.lang.String name)
  throws |java.net.MalformedURLException|
         |java.rmi.NotBoundException|
         |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         
Returns a reference, a stub, for the remote object associated with the specified name. 


    name - a name in URL format (without the scheme component) 

    Returns: a reference for a remote object 

*java.rmi.Naming.rebind(String,Remote)*

public static void rebind(
  java.lang.String name,
  java.rmi.Remote obj)
  throws |java.net.MalformedURLException|
         |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         
Rebinds the specified name to a new remote object. Any existing binding for the name is replaced. 


    name - a name in URL format (without the scheme component) 
    obj - new remote object to associate with the name 

*java.rmi.Naming.unbind(String)*

public static void unbind(java.lang.String name)
  throws |java.net.MalformedURLException|
         |java.rmi.NotBoundException|
         |java.rmi.RemoteException|
         
Destroys the binding for the specified name that is associated with a remote object. 


    name - a name in URL format (without the scheme component)
