*javax.management.QueryEval.getMBeanServer()*

public static |javax.management.MBeanServer| getMBeanServer()

Return the MBean server that was most recently given to the 
setMBeanServer(|javax.management.QueryEval|) method by this thread. If this 
thread never called that method, the result is the value its parent thread 
would have obtained from getMBeanServer at the moment of the creation of this 
thread, or null if there is no parent thread. 


    Returns: the MBean server. 
*javax.management.QueryEval.setMBeanServer(MBeanServer)*

public void setMBeanServer(javax.management.MBeanServer s)

Sets the MBean server on which the query is to be performed. The setting is 
valid for the thread performing the set. It is copied to any threads created by 
that thread at the moment of their creation. 

For historical reasons, this method is not static, but its behavior does not 
depend on the instance on which it is called. 

    s - The MBean server on which the query is to be performed.
