*javax.persistence.LockModeType_Description*

Lock modes that can be specified by means of the 
EntityManager.lock()(|javax.persistence.EntityManager|) method. 

The semantics of requesting locks of type 
LockModeType.READ(|javax.persistence.LockModeType|) and 
LockModeType.WRITE(|javax.persistence.LockModeType|) are the following. 

If transaction T1 calls lock(entity, 
LockModeType.READ(|javax.persistence.LockModeType|) ) on a versioned object, 
the entity manager must ensure that neither of the following phenomena can 
occur: 

P1 (Dirty read): Transaction T1 modifies a row. Another transaction T2 then 
reads that row and obtains the modified value, before T1 has committed or 
rolled back. Transaction T2 eventually commits successfully; it does not matter 
whether T1 commits or rolls back and whether it does so before or after T2 
commits. 

P2 (Non-repeatable read): Transaction T1 reads a row. Another transaction T2 
then modifies or deletes that row, before T1 has committed. Both transactions 
eventually commit successfully. 



Lock modes must always prevent the phenomena P1 and P2. 

In addition, calling lock(entity, LockModeType.WRITE) on a versioned object, 
will also force an update (increment) to the entity's version column. 

The persistence implementation is not required to support calling 
EntityManager.lock()(|javax.persistence.EntityManager|) on a non-versioned 
object. When it cannot support a such lock call, it must throw the 
(|javax.persistence.PersistenceException|) .
