*java.util.LinkedList_Description*

Linked list implementation of the List interface. Implements all optional list operations, and permits all elements (including null). In addition to implementing the List 
interface, the LinkedList class provides uniformly named methods to get, remove and insert an element at the beginning and end of the list. These operations allow linked lists to 
be used as a stack, queue, or double-ended queue (deque). 

The class implements the Queue interface, providing first-in-first-out queue operations for add, poll, etc. Other stack and deque operations could be easily recast in terms of the 
standard list operations. They're included here primarily for convenience, though they may run slightly faster than the equivalent List operations. 

All of the operations perform as could be expected for a doubly-linked list. Operations that index into the list will traverse the list from the beginning or the end, whichever is 
closer to the specified index. 

Note that this implementation is not synchronized. If multiple threads access a list concurrently, and at least one of the threads modifies the list structurally, it must be 
synchronized externally. (A structural modification is any operation that adds or deletes one or more elements; merely setting the value of an element is not a structural 
modification.) This is typically accomplished by synchronizing on some object that naturally encapsulates the list. If no such object exists, the list should be "wrapped" using 
the Collections.synchronizedList method. This is best done at creation time, to prevent accidental unsynchronized access to the list: 

List list = Collections.synchronizedList(new LinkedList(...)); 

The iterators returned by the this class's iterator and listIterator methods are fail-fast: if the list is structurally modified at any time after the iterator is created, in any 
way except through the Iterator's own remove or add methods, the iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator 
fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future. 

Note that the fail-fast behavior of an iterator cannot be guaranteed as it is, generally speaking, impossible to make any hard guarantees in the presence of unsynchronized 
concurrent modification. Fail-fast iterators throw ConcurrentModificationException on a best-effort basis. Therefore, it would be wrong to write a program that depended on this 
exception for its correctness: the fail-fast behavior of iterators should be used only to detect bugs. 

This class is a member of the <a href="/../guide/collections/index.html"> Java Collections Framework. 



*java.util.LinkedList()*

public LinkedList()

Constructs an empty list. 


*java.util.LinkedList(Collection<?extendsE>)*

public LinkedList(java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Constructs a list containing the elements of the specified collection, in the order they are returned by the collection's iterator. 

    c - the collection whose elements are to be placed into this list. 

*java.util.LinkedList.add(E)*

public boolean add(E o)

Appends the specified element to the end of this list. 


    o - element to be appended to this list. 

    Returns: true (as per the general contract of Collection.add). 

*java.util.LinkedList.add(int,E)*

public void add(
  int index,
  E element)

Inserts the specified element at the specified position in this list. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any subsequent elements to the right (adds one to 
their indices). 


    index - index at which the specified element is to be inserted. 
    element - element to be inserted. 

*java.util.LinkedList.addAll(Collection<?extendsE>)*

public boolean addAll(java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Appends all of the elements in the specified collection to the end of this list, in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator. The behavior of this 
operation is undefined if the specified collection is modified while the operation is in progress. (This implies that the behavior of this call is undefined if the specified 
Collection is this list, and this list is nonempty.) 


    c - the elements to be inserted into this list. 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.LinkedList.addAll(int,Collection<?extendsE>)*

public boolean addAll(
  int index,
  java.util.Collection<? extends E> c)

Inserts all of the elements in the specified collection into this list, starting at the specified position. Shifts the element currently at that position (if any) and any 
subsequent elements to the right (increases their indices). The new elements will appear in the list in the order that they are returned by the specified collection's iterator. 


    index - index at which to insert first element from the specified collection. 
    c - elements to be inserted into this list. 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 

*java.util.LinkedList.addFirst(E)*

public void addFirst(E o)

Inserts the given element at the beginning of this list. 


    o - the element to be inserted at the beginning of this list. 

*java.util.LinkedList.addLast(E)*

public void addLast(E o)

Appends the given element to the end of this list. (Identical in function to the add method; included only for consistency.)

public void clear()

Removes all of the elements from this list. 



*java.util.LinkedList.clone()*

public |java.lang.Object| clone()

    Returns: a shallow copy of this LinkedList instance. 

*java.util.LinkedList.contains(Object)*

public boolean contains(java.lang.Object o)

Returns true if this list contains the specified element. More formally, returns true if and only if this list contains at least one element e such that (o==null ? e==null : 
o.equals(e)). 


    o - element whose presence in this list is to be tested. 

    Returns: true if this list contains the specified element.

    Returns: the head of this queue. 

*java.util.LinkedList.get(int)*

public |E| get(int index)

Returns the element at the specified position in this list. 


    index - index of element to return. 

    Returns: the element at the specified position in this list. 

*java.util.LinkedList.getFirst()*

public |E| getFirst()

Returns the first element in this list. 



    Returns: the first element in this list. 

*java.util.LinkedList.getLast()*

public |E| getLast()

Returns the last element in this list. 



    Returns: the last element in this list. 

*java.util.LinkedList.indexOf(Object)*

public int indexOf(java.lang.Object o)

Returns the index in this list of the first occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if the List does not contain this element. More formally, returns the lowest index i such 
that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i))), or -1 if there is no such index. 


    o - element to search for. 

    Returns: the index in this list of the first occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if the list does not contain this element. 

*java.util.LinkedList.lastIndexOf(Object)*

public int lastIndexOf(java.lang.Object o)

Returns the index in this list of the last occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if the list does not contain this element. More formally, returns the highest index i such 
that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i))), or -1 if there is no such index. 


    o - element to search for. 

    Returns: the index in this list of the last occurrence of the specified element, or -1 if the list does not contain this element. 

*java.util.LinkedList.listIterator(int)*

public |java.util.ListIterator|<E> listIterator(int index)

Returns a list-iterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in the list. Obeys the general contract of List.listIterator(int). 

The list-iterator is fail-fast: if the list is structurally modified at any time after the Iterator is created, in any way except through the list-iterator's own remove or add 
methods, the list-iterator will throw a ConcurrentModificationException. Thus, in the face of concurrent modification, the iterator fails quickly and cleanly, rather than risking 
arbitrary, non-deterministic behavior at an undetermined time in the future. 


    index - index of first element to be returned from the list-iterator (by a call to next). 

    Returns: a ListIterator of the elements in this list (in proper sequence), starting at the specified position in the list. 

*java.util.LinkedList.offer(E)*

public boolean offer(E o)

Adds the specified element as the tail (last element) of this list. 


    o - the element to add. 

    Returns: true (as per the general contract of Queue.offer) 

*java.util.LinkedList.peek()*

public |E| peek()

Retrieves, but does not remove, the head (first element) of this list.

    Returns: the head of this queue. 

*java.util.LinkedList.remove(int)*

public |E| remove(int index)

from the list. 


    index - the index of the element to removed. 

    Returns: the element previously at the specified position. 

*java.util.LinkedList.remove(Object)*

public boolean remove(java.lang.Object o)

Removes the first occurrence of the specified element in this list. If the list does not contain the element, it is unchanged. More formally, removes the element with the lowest 
index i such that (o==null ? get(i)==null : o.equals(get(i))) (if such an element exists). 


    o - element to be removed from this list, if present. 

    Returns: true if the list contained the specified element. 

*java.util.LinkedList.removeFirst()*

public int size()

Returns the number of elements in this list. 



    Returns: the number of elements in this list. 

*java.util.LinkedList.toArray()*

public |java.lang.Object|[] toArray()

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in the correct order. 



    Returns: an array containing all of the elements in this list in the correct order. 

*java.util.LinkedList.toArray(T[])*

public |T|[] toArray(T[] a)

Returns an array containing all of the elements in this list in the correct order; the runtime type of the returned array is that of the specified array. If the list fits in the 
specified array, it is returned therein. Otherwise, a new array is allocated with the runtime type of the specified array and the size of this list. 

If the list fits in the specified array with room to spare (i.e., the array has more elements than the list), the element in the array immediately following the end of the 
collection is set to null. This is useful in determining the length of the list only if the caller knows that the list does not contain any null elements. 


    a - the array into which the elements of the list are to be stored, if it is big enough; otherwise, a new array of the same runtime type is allocated for this purpose. 

    Returns: an array containing the elements of the list.
