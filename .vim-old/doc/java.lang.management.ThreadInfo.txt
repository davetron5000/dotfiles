*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo_Description*

Thread information. ThreadInfo contains the information about a thread including: General thread information 

Thread ID. Name of the thread. 

Execution information 

Thread state. The object upon which the thread is blocked waiting to enter a synchronization block or waiting to be notified in a Object.wait(|java.lang.Object|) call. The ID of 
the thread that owns the object that the thread is blocked. Stack trace of the thread. 

Synchronization statistics 

The number of times that the thread has blocked for synchronization or waited for notification. The accumulated elapsed time that the thread has blocked for synchronization or 
waited for notification since thread contention monitoring was enabled. Some Java virtual machine implementation may not support this. The (|java.lang.management.ThreadMXBean|) 
method can be used to determine if a Java virtual machine supports this. 

This thread information class is designed for use in monitoring of the system, not for synchronization control. 

MXBean Mapping ThreadInfo is mapped to a CompositeData(|javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData|) with attributes as specified in the from(|java.lang.management.ThreadInfo|) 
method. 



*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.from(CompositeData)*

public static |java.lang.management.ThreadInfo| from(javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData cd)

Returns a ThreadInfo object represented by the given CompositeData. The given CompositeData must contain the following attributes: 



Attribute Name Type 

threadId java.lang.Long 

threadName java.lang.String 

threadState java.lang.String 

suspended java.lang.Boolean 

inNative java.lang.Boolean

stackTrace javax.management.openmbean.CompositeData[] 

Each element is a CompositeData representing StackTraceElement containing the following attributes: 



Attribute Name Type 

className java.lang.String 

methodName java.lang.String 

fileName java.lang.String 

lineNumber java.lang.Integer 

nativeMethod java.lang.Boolean 








    cd - CompositeData representing a ThreadInfo 

    Returns: a ThreadInfo object represented by cd if cd is not null; null otherwise. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getBlockedCount()*

public long getBlockedCount()

Returns the total number of times that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo blocked to enter or reenter a monitor. I.e. the number of times a thread has been in the 
BLOCKED(|java.lang.Thread.State|) state. 



    Returns: the total number of times that the thread entered the BLOCKED state. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getBlockedTime()*

public long getBlockedTime()

Returns the approximate accumulated elapsed time (in milliseconds) that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo has blocked to enter or reenter a monitor since thread 
contention monitoring is enabled. I.e. the total accumulated time the thread has been in the BLOCKED(|java.lang.Thread.State|) state since thread contention monitoring was last 
enabled. This method returns -1 if thread contention monitoring is disabled. 

The Java virtual machine may measure the time with a high resolution timer. This statistic is reset when the thread contention monitoring is reenabled. 



    Returns: the approximate accumulated elapsed time in milliseconds that a thread entered the BLOCKED state; -1 if thread contention monitoring is disabled. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getLockName()*

public |java.lang.String| getLockName()

Returns the string representation of the monitor lock that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is blocked to enter or waiting to be notified through the 
Object.wait(|java.lang.Object|) method. The returned string representation of a monitor lock consists of the name of the class of which the object is an instance, the at-sign 
character `@', and the unsigned hexadecimal representation of the identity hash code of the object. The returned string may not be unique depending on the implementation of the 
(|java.lang.System|) method. This method returns a string equals to the value of: 



lock.getClass().getName() + '@' + Integer.toHexString(System.identityHashCode(lock)) 

where lock is the monitor lock object. 

If the thread is not blocking to enter on any monitor object, or is not waiting on a monitor object for notification in a Object.wait call, this method returns null. 



    Returns: the string representation of the monitor lock that the thread is blocking to enter or waiting to be notified through the Object.wait method if any; null otherwise. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getLockOwnerId()*

public long getLockOwnerId()

Returns the ID of the thread which holds the monitor lock of an object on which the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is blocking. This method will return -1 if this thread 
is not blocked or waiting on any monitor, or if the monitor lock is not held by any thread. 



    Returns: the thread ID of the owner thread of the monitor lock of the object this thread is blocking on; -1 if this thread is not blocked or waiting on any monitor, or if the monitor lock 
             is not held by any thread. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getLockOwnerName()*

public |java.lang.String| getLockOwnerName()

Returns the name of the thread which holds the monitor lock of an object on which the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is blocking. This method will return null if this 
thread is not blocked or waiting on any monitor, or if the monitor lock is not held by any thread. 



    Returns: the name of the thread that holds the monitor lock of the object this thread is blocking on; null if this thread is not blocked or waiting on any monitor, or if the monitor lock 
             is not held by any thread. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getStackTrace()*

public |java.lang.StackTraceElement|[] getStackTrace()

Returns the stack trace of the thread associated with this ThreadInfo. If no stack trace was requested for this thread info, this method will return a zero-length array. If the 
returned array is of non-zero length then the first element of the array represents the top of the stack, which is the most recent method invocation in the sequence. The last 
element of the array represents the bottom of the stack, which is the least recent method invocation in the sequence. 

Some Java virtual machines may, under some circumstances, omit one or more stack frames from the stack trace. In the extreme case, a virtual machine that has no stack trace 
information concerning the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is permitted to return a zero-length array from this method. 



    Returns: an array of StackTraceElement objects of the thread. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getThreadId()*

public long getThreadId()

Returns the ID of the thread associated with this ThreadInfo. 



    Returns: the ID of the associated thread. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getThreadName()*

public |java.lang.String| getThreadName()

Returns the name of the thread associated with this ThreadInfo. 



    Returns: the name of the associated thread. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getThreadState()*

public |java.lang.Thread.State| getThreadState()

Returns the state of the thread associated with this ThreadInfo. 



    Returns: Thread.State of the associated thread. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getWaitedCount()*

public long getWaitedCount()

Returns the total number of times that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo waited for notification. I.e. the number of times that a thread has been in the 
WAITING(|java.lang.Thread.State|) or TIMED_WAITING(|java.lang.Thread.State|) state. 



    Returns: the total number of times that the thread was in the WAITING or TIMED_WAITING state. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.getWaitedTime()*

public long getWaitedTime()

Returns the approximate accumulated elapsed time (in milliseconds) that the thread associated with this ThreadInfo has waited for notification since thread contention monitoring 
is enabled. I.e. the total accumulated time the thread has been in the WAITING(|java.lang.Thread.State|) or TIMED_WAITING(|java.lang.Thread.State|) state since thread contention 
monitoring is enabled. This method returns -1 if thread contention monitoring is disabled. 

The Java virtual machine may measure the time with a high resolution timer. This statistic is reset when the thread contention monitoring is reenabled. 



    Returns: the approximate accumulated elapsed time in milliseconds that a thread has been in the WAITING or TIMED_WAITING state; -1 if thread contention monitoring is disabled. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.isInNative()*

public boolean isInNative()

Tests if the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is executing native code via the Java Native Interface (JNI). The JNI native code does not include the virtual machine support 
code or the compiled native code generated by the virtual machine. 



    Returns: true if the thread is executing native code; false otherwise. 

*java.lang.management.ThreadInfo.isSuspended()*

public boolean isSuspended()

Tests if the thread associated with this ThreadInfo is suspended. This method returns true if (|java.lang.Thread|) has been called.
