*javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution_Description*

Class PrinterResolution is a printing attribute class that specifies an exact resolution supported by a printer or to be used for a print job. This attribute assumes that printers 
have a small set of device resolutions at which they can operate rather than a continuum. 

PrinterResolution is used in multiple ways: 

When a client searches looking for a printer that supports the client's desired resolution exactly (no more, no less), the client specifies an instance of class PrinterResolution 
indicating the exact resolution the client wants. Only printers supporting that exact resolution will match the search. 

When a client needs to print a job using the client's desired resolution exactly (no more, no less), the client specifies an instance of class PrinterResolution as an attribute of 
the Print Job. This will fail if the Print Job doesn't support that exact resolution, and Fidelity is set to true. 

If a client wants to locate a printer supporting a resolution greater than some required minimum, then it may be necessary to exclude this attribute from a lookup request and to 
directly query the set of supported resolutions, and specify the one that most closely meets the client's requirements. In some cases this may be more simply achieved by 
specifying a PrintQuality attribute which often controls resolution. 

IPP Compatibility: The information needed to construct an IPP "printer-resolution" attribute can be obtained by calling methods on the PrinterResolution object. The category name 
returned by getName() gives the IPP attribute name. 



*javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution(int,int,int)*

public PrinterResolution(
  int crossFeedResolution,
  int feedResolution,
  int units)

Construct a new printer resolution attribute from the given items. 

    crossFeedResolution - Cross feed direction resolution. 
    feedResolution - Feed direction resolution. 
    units - Unit conversion factor, e.g. ResolutionSyntax.DPI or ResolutionSyntax.>DPCM. 

*javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution.equals(Object)*

public boolean equals(java.lang.Object object)

Returns whether this printer resolution attribute is equivalent to the passed in object. To be equivalent, all of the following conditions must be true: 

object is not null. 

object is an instance of class PrinterResolution. 

This attribute's cross feed direction resolution is equal to object's cross feed direction resolution. 

This attribute's feed direction resolution is equal to object's feed direction resolution. 


    object - Object to compare to. 

    Returns: True if object is equivalent to this printer resolution attribute, false otherwise. 

*javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution.getCategory()*

public final |java.lang.Class|<? extends javax.print.attribute.Attribute> getCategory()

Get the printing attribute class which is to be used as the "category" for this printing attribute value. 

For class PrinterResolution, the category is class PrinterResolution itself. 



    Returns: Printing attribute class (category), an instance of class {@link java.lang.Class java.lang.Class}. 

*javax.print.attribute.standard.PrinterResolution.getName()*

public final |java.lang.String| getName()

Get the name of the category of which this attribute value is an instance. 

For class PrinterResolution, the category name is "printer-resolution". 



    Returns: Attribute category name.
