*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList_Description*

A RoleUnresolvedList represents a list of RoleUnresolved objects, representing 
roles not retrieved from a relation due to a problem encountered when trying to 
access (read or write to roles). 


*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList()*

public RoleUnresolvedList()

Constructs an empty RoleUnresolvedList. 


*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList(int)*

public RoleUnresolvedList(int theInitialCapacity)

Constructs an empty RoleUnresolvedList with the initial capacity specified. 

    theInitialCapacity - initial capacity 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList(List)*

public RoleUnresolvedList(java.util.List theList)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         
Constructs a RoleUnresolvedList containing the elements of the List specified, 
in the order in which they are returned by the List's iterator. The 
RoleUnresolvedList instance has an initial capacity of 110% of the size of the 
List specified. 

    theList - list of RoleUnresolved objects 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.add(int,RoleUnresolved)*

public void add(
  int index,
  javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolved theRoleUnres)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         |java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException|
         
Inserts the unresolved role specified as an element at the position specified. 
Elements with an index greater than or equal to the current position are 
shifted up. 

    index - - The position in the list where the new RoleUnresolved object is to be 
       inserted. 
    theRoleUnres - - The RoleUnresolved object to be inserted. 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.add(RoleUnresolved)*

public void add(javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolved theRoleUnres)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         
Adds the RoleUnresolved specified as the last element of the list. 

    theRoleUnres - - the unresolved role to be added. 

*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.addAll(int,RoleUnresolvedList)*

public boolean addAll(
  int index,
  javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList theRoleUnresolvedList)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         |java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException|
         
Inserts all of the elements in the RoleUnresolvedList specified into this list, 
starting at the specified position, in the order in which they are returned by 
the Iterator of the RoleUnresolvedList specified. 

    index - - Position at which to insert the first element from the RoleUnresolvedList 
       specified. 
    theRoleUnresolvedList - - Elements to be inserted into the list. 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 
*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.addAll(RoleUnresolvedList)*

public boolean addAll(javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList theRoleUnresolvedList)
  throws |java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException|
         
Appends all the elements in the RoleUnresolvedList specified to the end of the 
list, in the order in which they are returned by the Iterator of the 
RoleUnresolvedList specified. 

    theRoleUnresolvedList - - Elements to be inserted into the list (can be null). 

    Returns: true if this list changed as a result of the call. 
*javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolvedList.set(int,RoleUnresolved)*

public void set(
  int index,
  javax.management.relation.RoleUnresolved theRoleUnres)
  throws |java.lang.IllegalArgumentException|
         |java.lang.IndexOutOfBoundsException|
         
Sets the element at the position specified to be the unresolved role specified. 
The previous element at that position is discarded. 

    index - - The position specified. 
    theRoleUnres - - The value to which the unresolved role element should be set.
