*javax.xml.xpath.XPath_Description*

XPath provides access to the XPath evaluation environment and expressions. 



Evaluation of XPath Expressions. 



context 

If a request is made to evaluate the expression in the absence of a context item, an empty document node will be used for the context. For the purposes of evaluating XPath 
expressions, a DocumentFragment is treated like a Document node. 



variables 

If the expression contains a variable reference, its value will be found through the (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathVariableResolver|) set with (|javax.xml.xpath.XPath|) . An 
(|javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException|) is raised if the variable resolver is undefined or the resolver returns null for the variable. The value of a variable must be 
immutable through the course of any single evaluation. 



functions 

If the expression contains a function reference, the function will be found through the (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathFunctionResolver|) set with (|javax.xml.xpath.XPath|) . An 
(|javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException|) is raised if the function resolver is undefined or the function resolver returns null for the function. 



QNames 

QNames in the expression are resolved against the XPath namespace context set with (|javax.xml.xpath.XPath|) . 



result 

This result of evaluating an expression is converted to an instance of the desired return type. Valid return types are defined in (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) . Conversion 
to the return type follows XPath conversion rules. 





*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.compile(String)*

public |javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpression| compile(java.lang.String expression)
  throws |javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException|
         
Compile an XPath expression for later evaluation. 

If expression contains any (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathFunction|) s, they must be available via the (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathFunctionResolver|) . An 
(|javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException|) will be thrown if the XPathFunction cannot be resovled with the XPathFunctionResolver. 

If expression is null, a NullPointerException is thrown. 


    expression - The XPath expression. 

    Returns: Compiled XPath expression. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.evaluate(String,InputSource)*

public |java.lang.String| evaluate(
  java.lang.String expression,
  org.xml.sax.InputSource source)
  throws |javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException|
         
Evaluate an XPath expression in the context of the specified InputSource and return the result as a String. 

This method calls (|javax.xml.xpath.XPath|) with a returnType of (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) . 

See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. 

If expression or source is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown. 


    expression - The XPath expression. 
    source - The InputSource of the document to evaluate over. 

    Returns: The String that is the result of evaluating the expression and converting the result to a String. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.evaluate(String,InputSource,QName)*

public |java.lang.Object| evaluate(
  java.lang.String expression,
  org.xml.sax.InputSource source,
  javax.xml.namespace.QName returnType)
  throws |javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException|
         
Evaluate an XPath expression in the context of the specified InputSource and return the result as the specified type. 

This method builds a data model for the (|org.xml.sax.InputSource|) and calls (|javax.xml.xpath.XPath|) on the resulting document object. 

See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. 

If returnType is not one of the types defined in (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) , then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. 

If expression, source or returnType is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown. 


    expression - The XPath expression. 
    source - The input source of the document to evaluate over. 
    returnType - The desired return type. 

    Returns: The Object that encapsulates the result of evaluating the expression. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.evaluate(String,Object)*

public |java.lang.String| evaluate(
  java.lang.String expression,
  java.lang.Object item)
  throws |javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException|
         
Evaluate an XPath expression in the specified context and return the result as a String. 

This method calls (|javax.xml.xpath.XPath|) with a returnType of (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) . 

See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. 

If a null value is provided for item, an empty document will be used for the context. If expression is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown. 


    expression - The XPath expression. 
    item - The starting context (node or node list, for example). 

    Returns: The String that is the result of evaluating the expression and converting the result to a String. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.evaluate(String,Object,QName)*

public |java.lang.Object| evaluate(
  java.lang.String expression,
  java.lang.Object item,
  javax.xml.namespace.QName returnType)
  throws |javax.xml.xpath.XPathExpressionException|
         
Evaluate an XPath expression in the specified context and return the result as the specified type. 

See Evaluation of XPath Expressions for context item evaluation, variable, function and QName resolution and return type conversion. 

If returnType is not one of the types defined in (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) ( NUMBER(|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) , STRING(|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) , 
BOOLEAN(|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) , NODE(|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) or NODESET(|javax.xml.xpath.XPathConstants|) ) then an IllegalArgumentException is thrown. 

If a null value is provided for item, an empty document will be used for the context. If expression or returnType is null, then a NullPointerException is thrown. 


    expression - The XPath expression. 
    item - The starting context (node or node list, for example). 
    returnType - The desired return type. 

    Returns: Result of evaluating an XPath expression as an Object of returnType. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.getNamespaceContext()*

public |javax.xml.namespace.NamespaceContext| getNamespaceContext()

Return the current namespace context. 

null is returned in no namespace context is in effect. 



    Returns: Current Namespace context. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.getXPathFunctionResolver()*

public |javax.xml.xpath.XPathFunctionResolver| getXPathFunctionResolver()

Return the current function resolver. 

null is returned in no function resolver is in effect. 



    Returns: Current function resolver. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.getXPathVariableResolver()*

public |javax.xml.xpath.XPathVariableResolver| getXPathVariableResolver()

Return the current variable resolver. 

null is returned in no variable resolver is in effect. 



    Returns: Current variable resolver. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.reset()*

public void reset()

Reset this XPath to its original configuration. 

XPath is reset to the same state as when it was created with (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathFactory|) . reset() is designed to allow the reuse of existing XPaths thus saving resources 
associated with the creation of new XPaths. 

The reset XPath is not guaranteed to have the same (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathFunctionResolver|) , (|javax.xml.xpath.XPathVariableResolver|) or 
(|javax.xml.namespace.NamespaceContext|) Objects, e.g. (|java.lang.Object|) . It is guaranteed to have a functionally equal XPathFunctionResolver, XPathVariableResolver and 
NamespaceContext. 



*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.setNamespaceContext(NamespaceContext)*

public void setNamespaceContext(javax.xml.namespace.NamespaceContext nsContext)

Establish a namespace context. 

A NullPointerException is thrown if nsContext is null. 


    nsContext - Namespace context to use. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.setXPathFunctionResolver(XPathFunctionResolver)*

public void setXPathFunctionResolver(javax.xml.xpath.XPathFunctionResolver resolver)

Establish a function resolver. 

A NullPointerException is thrown if resolver is null. 


    resolver - XPath function resolver. 

*javax.xml.xpath.XPath.setXPathVariableResolver(XPathVariableResolver)*

public void setXPathVariableResolver(javax.xml.xpath.XPathVariableResolver resolver)

Establish a variable resolver. 

A NullPointerException is thrown if resolver is null.
