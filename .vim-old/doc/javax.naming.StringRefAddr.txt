*javax.naming.StringRefAddr_Description*

This class represents the string form of the address of a communications end-point. It consists of a type that describes the communication mechanism and a string contents specific 
to that communication mechanism. The format and interpretation of the address type and the contents of the address are based on the agreement of three parties: the client that 
uses the address, the object/server that can be reached using the address, and the administrator or program that creates the address. 

An example of a string reference address is a host name. Another example of a string reference address is a URL. 

A string reference address is immutable: once created, it cannot be changed. Multithreaded access to a single StringRefAddr need not be synchronized. 



*javax.naming.StringRefAddr(String,String)*

public StringRefAddr(
  java.lang.String addrType,
  java.lang.String addr)

Constructs a new instance of StringRefAddr using its address type and contents. 

    addrType - A non-null string describing the type of the address. 
    addr - The possibly null contents of the address in the form of a string. 

*javax.naming.StringRefAddr.getContent()*

public |java.lang.Object| getContent()

Retrieves the contents of this address. The result is a string. 



    Returns: The possibly null address contents.
