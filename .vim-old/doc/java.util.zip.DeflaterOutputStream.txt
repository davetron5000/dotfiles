*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream_Description*

This class implements an output stream filter for compressing data in the "deflate" compression format. It is also used as the basis for other types of compression filters, such 
as GZIPOutputStream. 



*byte[]_java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.buf*

Output buffer for writing compressed data. 


*java.util.zip.Deflater_java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.def*

Compressor for this stream. 



*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream)*

public DeflaterOutputStream(java.io.OutputStream out)

Creates a new output stream with a default compressor and buffer size. 

    out - the output stream 

*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream,Deflater)*

public DeflaterOutputStream(
  java.io.OutputStream out,
  java.util.zip.Deflater def)

Creates a new output stream with the specified compressor and a default buffer size. 

    out - the output stream 
    def - the compressor ("deflater") 

*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream(OutputStream,Deflater,int)*

public DeflaterOutputStream(
  java.io.OutputStream out,
  java.util.zip.Deflater def,
  int size)

Creates a new output stream with the specified compressor and buffer size. 

    out - the output stream 
    def - the compressor ("deflater") 
    size - the output buffer size 

*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.close()*

public void close()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes remaining compressed data to the output stream and closes the underlying stream. 



*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.deflate()*

protected void deflate()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes next block of compressed data to the output stream. 



*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.finish()*

public void finish()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Finishes writing compressed data to the output stream without closing the underlying stream. Use this method when applying multiple filters in succession to the same output 
stream. 



*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.write(byte[],int,int)*

public void write(
  byte[] b,
  int off,
  int len)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes an array of bytes to the compressed output stream. This method will block until all the bytes are written. 


    b - the data to be written 
    off - the start offset of the data 
    len - the length of the data 

*java.util.zip.DeflaterOutputStream.write(int)*

public void write(int b)
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Writes a byte to the compressed output stream. This method will block until the byte can be written. 


    b - the byte to be written
