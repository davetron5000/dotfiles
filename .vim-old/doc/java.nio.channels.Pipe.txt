*java.nio.channels.Pipe_Description*

A pair of channels that implements a unidirectional pipe. 

A pipe consists of a pair of channels: A writable </code>sink<code>(|java.nio.channels.Pipe.SinkChannel|) channel and a readable 
</code>source<code>(|java.nio.channels.Pipe.SourceChannel|) channel. Once some bytes are written to the sink channel they can be read from source channel in exactly the order in 
which they were written. 

Whether or not a thread writing bytes to a pipe will block until another thread reads those bytes, or some previously-written bytes, from the pipe is system-dependent and 
therefore unspecified. Many pipe implementations will buffer up to a certain number of bytes between the sink and source channels, but such buffering should not be assumed. 



*java.nio.channels.Pipe()*

protected Pipe()

Initializes a new instance of this class. 


*java.nio.channels.Pipe.open()*

public static |java.nio.channels.Pipe| open()
  throws |java.io.IOException|
         
Opens a pipe. 

The new pipe is created by invoking the openPipe(|java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider|) method of the system-wide default (|java.nio.channels.spi.SelectorProvider|) object. 



    Returns: 

*java.nio.channels.Pipe.sink()*

public abstract |java.nio.channels.Pipe.SinkChannel| sink()

Returns this pipe's sink channel. 



    Returns: This pipe's sink channel 

*java.nio.channels.Pipe.source()*

public abstract |java.nio.channels.Pipe.SourceChannel| source()

Returns this pipe's source channel. 



    Returns: This pipe's source channel
